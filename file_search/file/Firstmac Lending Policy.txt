1 Introduction 
Firstmac’s lending guidelines have been developed to assist Brokers and Originator / Mortgage 
Managers in writing mortgage loans with a risk profile consistent with that expected of AAA 
rated mortgage loan securities and industry best practice generally.  
Firstmac is prepared to look at the merit of loans on an individual basis. Ultimately however, if 
mortgage insurance is unavailable on a transaction, Firstmac cannot accept the loan into the 
program unless specifically allowed under Firstmac policy.  Any exceptions to policy may be 
considered on case by case basis by Firstmac credit and where considered appropriate, should 
be mortgage insured.  
This Policy should be read in conjunction with other Firstmac updates, guidelines and 
operations manuals which together form the basis for providing residential loan funding under 
the mortgage program. 
Firstmac’s lending guidelines are governed by the Firstmac Credit Committee Charter. 
All loans submitted and processed through Firstmac or the Firstmac Residential Program must 
comply with the specific requirements of the Firstmac Residential Lending Policy and all other 
guidelines and procedures as advised from time to time by Firstmac.  
All parties must also ensure that they also comply with the specific Responsible Lending 
requirements. 
All loans being documented must also comply with the requirements in the Documents and 
Procedures Manual as amended from time to time, under the Firstmac Residential Program. 
2 Purpose of the Lending Policy 
This policy contains guidelines for residential lending nationwide. It is intended as an easy 
reference manual to lending guidelines, acceptable credit standards and macro processes.  
The principles presented in this policy should not be interpreted as a set of inflexible rules, but 
as a set of guidelines, to be practiced in association with prudent lending practices and 
common sense. Every application should be assessed on its own merit.  
2.1 Policy Exceptions 
Loans that are outside the guidelines presented in this policy may still be considered if there are 
inherent strengths to the transaction; credit risks can be mitigated with justification and 
sufficient supporting documentation can be provided which would enable the loans to be 
approved.  
3 Responsibilities 
All parties have particular responsibilities to be fulfilled to ensure prudent lending practices are 
followed.

Originator / Mortgage Manager and Brokers 
Originator / Mortgage Manager or Originator / Mortgage Manager Agents or Brokers must 
perform the following tasks:  
• Conduct loan interview, discuss loan options and determine the most suitable loan 
product for the customer 
• Advise the customer about the approval process  
• Assist customer with the preparation of the loan application if required  
• Sight all original verification documents required in support of the loan application, 
check their authenticity and obtain copies for their file, and forward copies to Firstmac.  
• Complete the Customer Identification and Verification form after comparing the 
borrower and their signature with the photographic ID and taking a copy of the 
identification documents or any other identification procedures as advised and required 
by Firstmac. 
In addition, Originator/Mortgage Manager only must perform the following tasks:  
• Using the White Pages or Yellow Pages Telephone Directory, independently verify the 
telephone number of the employer/accountant and contact the employer /accountant 
by telephone to confirm employment details. A file note is raised noting the name of the 
caller; the number called; the date and time of the call and the name/position of the 
person providing the confirmation and full details of what was confirmed ie income, 
length of employment, position etc. Print a copy of the White / Yellow Pages listing 
submit with the loan package and retain a copy on file. NOTE. Under no circumstances 
are mobile phone numbers or numbers supplied by third parties to be used. 
• Obtain credit reports on all parties to the loan application together with associated 
companies; proprietorships; possible matches and cross-linked files  
• Obtain valuations of the security properties  
• Prepare and submit Lender’s Mortgage Insurance application for approval  
Firstmac Credit 
• Performs Valuer checks  
• Undertakes a credit assessment and review of all loan applications to ensure compliance 
with program parameters  
• Advises the Originator / Mortgage Manager or Broker if more information is required or 
of any special conditions. It would be expected that the requirement for additional 
information would occur rarely as the Originator / Mortgage Manager or Broker would 
supply all the required information with the application 
• Approves, declines or defers the application  
• Undertakes ongoing audit

3.1 National Consumer Credit Protection Act (“NCCP”) 
The Uniform Consumer Credit Code was replaced by the National Credit Code (‘’NCC’’) on 1 July 
2010.  
The NCCP requires all businesses operating in the consumer credit to: 
• Be licensed or appointed a credit representative (subject to certain exceptions) 
• Comply with the National Consumer Credit Code 
The NCCP applies to Firstmac and to Originators/Mortgage Managers and Brokers. It is 
important that employees and any agents of Firstmac know how the NCCP affects the policies 
and procedures and processes of Firstmac. Ongoing compliance with the NCCP is mandatory. 
All Originators/Mortgage Managers, Brokers or Introducers, and their representatives and 
employees involved with any credit related activities under the NCCP are required to observe 
and comply with the guidelines. 
Firstmac expects any Originator/Mortgage Manager, Broker or Introducer to suggest or 
recommend to an applicant only those arrangements for finance that the Originator/Mortgage 
Manager, Broker or Introducer genuinely and reasonably believes is ‘not unsuitable’ to the 
needs of that applicant after undertaking an assessment of the applicant’s capacity to repay the 
loan.  Firstmac applies this standard to all loans and not just NCCP regulated loans. 
The Originator/Mortgage Manager, Broker or Introducer warrants and represents that each of 
their staff and/or representative processing a mortgage loan application which is assessed and 
submitted to Firstmac has been trained on and understand their obligations under Firstmac's 
Lending Policy and requirements and obligations under the NCCP including the responsible 
lending obligations. 
If there are any queries, please direct them to your contact or BDM at Firstmac. 
3.2 Firstmac Credit Assessment 
 Firstmac undertakes individual credit assessments using its systems, policies and process to 
assess whether it is likely that the borrower will be able to comply with their financial 
obligations under the contract without substantial hardship.  
‘Substantial hardship’ is defined to exist if the borrower could only comply with the obligation 
by: 
• selling their principle place of residence (and does not intend to at the time of the 
contract); or  
• would fail to make rental payments on the principal place of residence. 
Firstmac assesses credit risk primarily on the strength of a borrower’s capacity to repay the loan 
without substantial hardship. While the security provided is also considered, reliance on the 
security is not a substitute for a credit assessment of a borrower’s repayment capacity. 
 
 

 
7 
Firstmac Limited ABN 59 094 145 963 
AFSL/Australian Credit Licence 290600 
 
Firstmac’s assessment includes: 
• making reasonable enquiries about the consumers’ financial situation and 
circumstances, and their requirements and objective 
• taking reasonable steps to verify the consumers’ financial situation  
• making a preliminary (Originator/Mortgage Manager, Broker or Introducer) or final 
assessment (lenders) about whether the credit is ‘not unsuitable’ for the consumer 
All loans submitted and processed through Firstmac or the Firstmac Residential Program must 
comply with this Policy, the specific requirements of the Firstmac Residential Lending Policy and 
all other guidelines and procedures as advised from time to time by Firstmac 
If the loan application or information provided on any given application does not adequately 
demonstrate that an appropriate level of enquiry or loan assessment have been undertaken, 
then Firstmac may request that additional information be provided and submitted. 
In addition to complying with all the current Firstmac lending policy and underwriting 
requirements as amended from time to time, Firstmac also requires that all 
Originator/Mortgage Managers, Brokers or Introducers make specific enquiries relating to the 
following: 
• Is customer aware of information relevant to their loan application that has not been 
provided and may have an adverse impact on their financial circumstances?   
• Is customer aware of any future change in their employment which may adversely affect 
his/her/their ability to meet their current and future financial obligations? 
• Does customer anticipate any increase to their expenses/liabilities over the next 12 
months (e.g. ill health or disability, a possible claim requiring payment, end of interest 
free or honeymoon period on a loan)? 
• Does customer anticipate any decrease to their income during the next 12 months (e.g. 
extended leave, retirement, reduction in overtime)? 
• Does customer anticipate any reduction in profit/income/cash flow to their business 
activities during the next 12 months? 
Originator/Mortgage Managers, Brokers and Introducers will also need to take into account and 
consider the following: 
• ability of the customer to meet his or her financial obligations under the Proposed 
Contract or ability to meet obligations without substantial hardship 
• take reasonable steps to verify the customer’s financial situation 
• assess according to the information provided by the customer about their objectives 
and requirements 
• with regard to the stated loan purpose, there is an obligation to determine whether or 
not a loan is “not unsuitable” and an important part of that is to identify in more detail 

 
8 
Firstmac Limited ABN 59 094 145 963 
AFSL/Australian Credit Licence 290600 
 
about the stated purpose, what the funds are to be used for, and ensure that the 
settlement proceeds are applied so far as we are able for that purpose.  
3.3 Assessment period 
All Originator/Mortgage Managers, Brokers and Introducers must make the preliminary 
assessment within 90 days of when the credit assistance is provided. This will be when the 
Originator/Mortgage Manager, Broker or Introducer assist the borrower to apply for a loan or 
an increase to a loan.  Assisting a borrower arrange a settlement is not credit assistance, and so 
the assessment does not need to be within 90 days of loan settlement. 
The assessment must be made within 90 days of when the loan contract is entered or loan 
principal amount is increased (120 days if the loan is used for the purchase of residential 
property and is secured by a mortgage over that residential property).  The time limit for new 
loans relates to the date of the credit contract, not the loan settlement date, whereas the time 
limit for loan principal amount increases relates to the date the loan principal amount is 
increased, not the contract date. 
The assessment must state the period it covers. 
Originator/Mortgage Managers, Brokers and Introducers will need to keep a record of the steps 
taken to make reasonable enquiries; and to verify the consumers’ financial situation. The 
Originator/Mortgage Manager, Broker or Introducer must retain a written (includes electronic) 
copy of the preliminary assessment and provide it to borrowers on request made within seven 
years of the date of the credit assistance.  Note that these procedures apply equally to principal 
increases as to new loans. The assessment can be wholly in electronic form (ie a suitable record 
on a system) but needs to contain a statement that a credit assessment has been made on a 
specified date and the period for which it applies. 
4 Loan approvals 
A Delegated Lending Authority (DLA) is issued to Firstmac employees only. 
All Firstmac DLA Holders are required to assess each loan in accordance with the Firstmac 
Residential Lending Policy and the Lender’s Mortgage Insurer Guidelines (where required). 
Final approval of a loan will only be issued once a Firstmac DLA Holder with appropriate level of 
authority has reviewed the application, valuation, supporting documentation held and where 
applicable, Lender’s Mortgage Insurance (LMI) is held. Loans not requiring Lender’s Mortgage 
Insurance (Non-LMI) 
Eligible loans will be considered without Lender’s Mortgage Insurance (LMI).  
While the LVR is a key factor in determining whether a loan can be approved without LMI, other 
borrower and loan characteristics are taken in to consideration. As a result, there will be loans 
with an LVR less than 80% that Firstmac will deem require LMI (refer Lender’s Mortgage 
Insurance (LMI)).

Firstmac Limited ABN 59 094 145 963 
AFSL/Australian Credit Licence 290600 
 
5 Risk Fee  
A Risk Fee will be charged for loans with characteristics that represent a greater risk of loss. 
The Risk Fee type and amount will vary depending on the loan amount and LVR, with pricing to 
be determined by Firstmac and reviewed from time to time. 
The Risk Fee is payable by the borrower, and may be capitalised to the loan, provided the total 
loan amount including the Risk Fee does not exceed the limits outlined throughout this policy.   
No part of the Risk Fee is refundable when a loan is repaid, or if the LVR is reduced, regardless 
of how long the loan has been operating. 
5.1 Lender Risk Fee (LRF) – LVR > 80% and < 90% 
Loans with LVR > 80% < 90% may be considered without LMI where all below criteria is met: 
• Security is in a Category 1a or Category 1b postcode as shown Firstmac Acceptable 
Security Location guide; and  
• Maximum loan amount (inclusive of LRF capitalised): 
o $1,000,000 where all security is in Category 1a postcode 
o $750,000 where any security is in a Category 1b postcode; and 
• Maximum LVR < 90% (inclusive of LRF capitalised); and 
• Repayments are Principal & Interest (not available for Interest Only); and 
• All other standard credit criteria & residential lending policy is met. 
• Exclusions: 
o Loan is included in When LMI is required 
o Any construction loan 
o Any loan to a non-resident borrower or SMSF 
o Apartments / units in a development > 6 floors & in a high density postcode as 
per Firstmac Acceptable Security Location guide 
Additional restrictions or exclusions as determined by Firstmac from time to time. Loans that do 
not meet the above criteria require Lender’s Mortgage Insurance. 
5.2 Investor Risk Fee (PRF) 
An Investor Risk Fee will be charged where: 
• 
Borrower has investment lending only with Firstmac (ie owner occupied loan/security 
held by another Lender; or no owner occupied property at all), and 
• 
Debt to Income ratio (DTI)* of 8.0:1 or above, and 
• 
LVR > 70% 
* DTI is the total of all credit facility / debt limits divided by the total gross income 

 
10 
Firstmac Limited ABN 59 094 145 963 
AFSL/Australian Credit Licence 290600 
 
All standard credit criteria applies, plus the following: 
• 
Maximum LVR 80% before PRF is capitalised. 
• 
Where capitalising the IRF causes the LVR to go over 80%, loan repayments must be 
principal and interest. 
• 
Exit strategy must be provided by the Borrower, regardless of the age of Borrower at 
time of application. It is important that the borrower demonstrates awareness of their 
leveraged position and actively considers their future strategy. 
6 Lender’s Mortgage Insurance (LMI)  
Lender's Mortgage Insurance (LMI) is protection for the lender, as it insures against any 
shortfall of monies in the event of a forced sale of the security property. The borrower must be 
made aware that this is the case and that it does not cover the borrower if any repayment is 
missed or loss incurred as a result of loan default. 
All loans which fall into the parameters outlined in When LMI is required must be 100% lender's 
mortgage insured, with Cash Flow Cover for all loans with LVR > 80%. 
Where an existing loan is mortgage insured without Cash Flow Cover due to the original LVR < 
80%, Firstmac may require Cash Flow Cover on this loan where any variation is completed that 
results in the LVR now exceeding 80%.  
The current approved insurers are: 
• Helia Insurance Pty Limited (formerly Genworth Financial Mortgage Insurance Pty 
Limited) 
• 
QBE Lenders’ Mortgage Insurance Limited 
• 
and respective related companies of these two insurers, as advised. 
For loans requiring LMI, the requirements of the Mortgage Insurer must also be observed, 
whether they are consistent with provisions in this policy or not.  The Mortgage Insurer policy 
however is not to supersede or override Firstmac’s policy. 
As a duty of disclosure under the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 attaches to applications for LMI 
cover, the Originator / Mortgage Manager must ensure that any matter known, or that could 
reasonably have been expected to be known, and that would be relevant to the insurer’s 
decision to accept the risk, is disclosed. To withhold information relevant to the insurer’s 
decision to insure a loan could make the insurance policy invalid and jeopardise Firstmac’s 
position. 
Firstmac will not allow any loan to settle where the LMI undertaking has any approval condition 
outstanding. 
 
 

 
11 
Firstmac Limited ABN 59 094 145 963 
AFSL/Australian Credit Licence 290600 
 
6.1 When LMI is required 
Loan applications with any of the following features are required to be mortgage insured prior 
to final approval: 
• Any loan where LVR exceeds 80% that does not meet LRF eligibility criteria 
• Any construction loan where LVR exceeds 80% 
• Any additional or further advances to existing loans which are: 
o currently mortgage insured; or 
o currently non-lmi and no longer eligible for non-lmi 
(note – LMI premium will be calculated on the new total loan amount) 
• Any loan application where mortgage insurance is considered appropriate by Firstmac, 
regardless of the LVR  
6.2 LMI Premium 
Current LMI premium calculators / rates are available on the Firstmac website. 
Firstmac will not be responsible for any premium where any third party has incorrectly quoted 
or advised a borrower that no premium is payable by the borrower. 
Firstmac will pay the LMI premium on: 
• New loans where LVR < 80% and total loan amount does not exceed $1,000,000 
• Additional advances or further advances against a security that is held for a loan that is 
currently mortgage insured, provided the increase amount is > $25,000, LVR remains 
below 80% and total loan amount does not exceed $1,000,000. 
Where a borrower seeks a variation to a loan which is currently mortgage insured after it has 
settled, other than an increase to the loan amount, any LMI premium or administration fee 
charged by a Lender's Mortgage Insurer is always payable by the borrower, regardless of 
whether or not the borrower was required to pay the premium on the original loan.  
7 Borrowers, guarantors, and mortgagors  
It is a requirement of the National Credit Code (NCC) that a mortgage cannot be taken from 
anyone other than a borrower or a guarantor. Borrowers and guarantors can be individuals, 
corporations or trusts (family, discretionary & unit trusts only).  
Excluded borrowers and Guarantors are Limited liability companies, Associations, Churches, 
Clubs and minors (persons under the age of 18).  
 
 
 

 
12 
Firstmac Limited ABN 59 094 145 963 
AFSL/Australian Credit Licence 290600 
 
7.1 Maximum Borrower exposure 
The maximum exposure to any one borrower is up to $3 million.  
Exposures above this amount may be considered on an exceptional, case by case basis. Any 
such exceptions where supported by Firstmac Credit, may require Lender’s Mortgage Insurance 
on all, or part of the total exposure. 
7.2 Age of borrower / guarantor  
Firstmac does not discriminate against borrowers on the basis of age however, Firstmac does 
not lend to or accept guarantees from persons under the age of 18. 
The age of any borrower / guarantor at the end of the loan term is not to exceed 90 years of 
age. The requested loan term may be reduced to meet this requirement, refer policy section 
Loan Term for details of minimum and maximum loan terms available. 
7.3 Borrowers approaching retirement age 
Where a borrower is > 50 years of age or older at the time of application, and the loan term 
exceeds the borrower’s deemed retirement age of 67 years, consideration must be given to the 
borrower’s exit strategy ie how the loan will be serviced, or repaid, when the income from 
employment ceases. 
An exit strategy should take in to consideration the borrower’s remaining time in the 
workforce, their age at the end of the proposed loan term, their ability to continue servicing the 
loan, or repay the loan in full without incurring substantial hardship post retirement. 
7.3.1 Obtaining the exit strategy 
The exit strategy should come from the borrower and is to be retained on the loan file as 
follows: 
• Borrower age 60 or younger at application   
o Broker to discuss the exit strategy with the borrower & provide detailed notes to 
Firstmac by email, or a written statement from the borrower to be retained on 
the loan file. 
• Borrower age 61 or older at application 
o The exit strategy must be from the borrower. 
o It can be by email (direct or via the Broker) and is to be retained on the loan file. 
• Borrower age 70 or older at application 
o As for borrower age 61 or older, plus independent legal advice required. 
7.3.2 Exit strategy options & details to be obtained 
Below are some examples of what information might be included in an exit strategy, however it 
is not required to specifically reference answers to all of the questions posed below. For 
example, stating an intention to sell an investment or other asset post retirement does not 

 
13 
Firstmac Limited ABN 59 094 145 963 
AFSL/Australian Credit Licence 290600 
 
require a specific date, or expected amount to be realised from the sale. The reasonableness of 
an exit strategy can be assessed using the total assets and liabilities provided by the borrower, 
and current asset values. 
Example: 
Propose to repay the loan prior to retirement other than selling the property 
• 
Does the borrower have sufficient income / savings / identified source of funds? 
Selling an owner-occupied property being funded  
• 
When does the borrower plan to sell? 
• 
Does the borrower have a reasonable plan for accommodation after sale? 
• 
At the time of the planned sale, will the likely equity position mean the borrower can pay 
the outstanding balance of the loan? 
 Selling an investment property being funded 
• 
When does the borrower plan to sell? 
• 
At the time of the planned sale, will the likely equity position mean the borrower can pay 
the outstanding balance of the loan? 
Selling another investment property / other asset 
• 
What does the borrower plan to sell? 
• 
When does the borrower plan to sell it?  
• 
At the time of the planned sale, will the likely equity position mean the borrower can pay 
the outstanding balance of the loan? 
Using income from other investments to make a lump sum repayment in full 
• 
Will the likely proceeds from the other investments be sufficient to pay the outstanding 
balance of the loan?  
Plan to convert the property being funded to an investment property in the future 
• 
When does the borrower plan to convert the property to investment? 
• 
At the time of the planned conversion, will the like rental income be sufficient to make 
the repayments under the loan? 
Using superannuation to continue to pay down / off the loan 
• 
Are the superannuation benefits sufficient to meet the borrower’s ongoing financial 
needs plus the repayments under the loan? 
Using savings to continue to pay down / off the loan 
• 
Are the savings sufficient to meet the borrower’s ongoing financial needs plus the 
repayments under the loan?

7.4 Joint borrowers  
Where there are joint borrowers it is important to ensure that: 
• No borrower is acting under the duress of another 
• All borrowers receive a benefit from the loan  
• All borrowers are fully informed with regard to all aspects of the loan  
7.5 Borrowers of convenience 
A “borrower of convenience” is defined as a borrower that is added to the loan application to 
provide serviceability and/or security but does not receive a tangible benefit from the loan 
transaction.  
Borrowers must have a beneficial interest in the loan transaction either by way of joint 
ownership of the security and/or dependence on the mortgagor in a marital / defacto 
relationship. 
It is not acceptable for a person to be joined in a loan simply to provide income support for 
servicing, or simply to provide added security for another party to purchase a property. 
7.6 Third party mortgages/guarantees 
Firstmac will consider loans that are supported by a third party security where the borrower 
and mortgagor are common law spouses. 
Examples of acceptable third party mortgages: 
Borrower  
Mortgagor / Guarantor 
A & B Smith 
A Smith (or B Smith) 
A (or B) Smith  
A & B Smith 
A Smith  
B Smith 
 
Independent legal advice is to be obtained by the third party borrower / mortgagor in the 
following cases: 
Investment property as security: 
• All loans structured with Borrower: A Smith and Mortgagor/guarantor: B Smith 
• Refinance – where the structure of the new loan is not the same structure held with the 
outgoing lender, regardless of the new structure. 
• Purchase – all loans, regardless of the structure. 
 

 
15 
Firstmac Limited ABN 59 094 145 963 
AFSL/Australian Credit Licence 290600 
 
Owner occupied property as security: 
• All loans structured with Borrower: A Smith and Mortgagor/guarantor: B Smith 
• For all other owner occupied property structures, independent legal and financial advice 
is not mandatory, but will be recommended in the loan agreement. The third party 
borrower / mortgagor (guarantor) may choose not to obtain the advice, by 
acknowledging as follows:  
o Third party Borrower – Borrower Certification form issued with loan 
documentation must be completed to reflect advice not being obtained; 
o Third party Mortgagor (Guarantor) – the Guarantor loan documentation pack 
will include the relevant certificates to be completed when advice is obtained, 
however, will also include a Waiver Declaration for the Guarantor to sign should 
they choose not to obtain independent advice. 
7.6.1 Corporate borrowers 
Loans to corporate borrowers must be supported by the unlimited joint and several guarantees 
of the company director/s, unless waived by Firstmac (and the Mortgage Insurers, if applicable) 
e.g. nominal directors will not normally be required to provide a guarantee. 
Where a loan is to an individual/s who own/s a company, and the servicing of the loan is 
dependent upon the income derived from that company, the guarantee of the company must 
be obtained.  
7.7 Trust borrowers 
Loans to trusts (family, discretionary & unit trusts only) are to be provided to both the trust and 
the trustee/s in their own right. Where the trustee is a company, the unlimited joint and several 
guarantees of the directors of the trustee company is required.  
In order to reduce the risk of challenges to the validity of guarantees, guarantors are required 
to obtain independent legal advice regarding the provision of a guarantee. In certain 
circumstances Firstmac may consider waiving this requirement e.g. sole trader company.  
Loans to Trustee/s of a Self-Managed Super Fund (SMSF) may be considered, refer to section 
Self Managed Super Funds (SMSF) for specific requirements. 
7.7.1 Hybrid Trusts  
Hybrid trusts are a combination of discretionary and unit trusts which are generally very 
complex and tax driven. The loan structure required to gain the benefit of the trust and the 
inability to identify the beneficiaries of any cash flow make them unsuitable borrowers. 
Firstmac does not lend to hybrid trusts. 
7.8 Non-English speaking borrowers  
Firstmac will lend to non-English speaking borrowers, however they must employ the services 
of a qualified, independent and professional translation service and provide a certificate 
verifying the documents have been independently translated. A template of an acceptable 
certificate is available from Firstmac.

7.9 Powers of Attorney 
Firstmac does not accept loan applications or legal documents, signed under power of attorney 
except in the case of corporate borrowers. Where the borrower is overseas, special 
arrangements can be made for the delivery and execution of documents subject to a business 
case being put to Firstmac. 
8 Non-resident borrowers  
For the purposes of these guidelines, a non-resident is deemed to be: 
• Any person who resides and is employed in Australia, who does not have permanent 
residency status in Australia 
and / or 
• Any person who resides and is employed in another country.  
Applications for loans (including Additional & Further Advances), will only be considered for 
Australian or New Zealand citizens, who are living and working overseas. 
Australian or New Zealand citizenship is to be confirmed by certified copy of Australian or New 
Zealand passport. 
Standard policy (ie not ‘non-resident’) can be applied to: 
• Applicants who are Australian or New Zealand citizens living & working in New Zealand; 
• Applicants living and working in Australia who are not Australian or New Zealand 
citizens, provided at least one of the applicants holds permanent residency status (to be 
confirmed by certified copy of passport and Visa Entitlement Verification Online 
(VEVO)). The applicant without permanent residency status must be the common law 
spouse of the applicant who is an Australian or New Zealand citizen, and must hold an 
appropriate partner visa. 
• Applicants who are living and working in Australia where one applicant only is an 
Australian or New Zealand citizen, provided the ‘non-citizen’ applicant is a common law 
spouse of the applicant who is an Australian or New Zealand citizen and holds 
appropriate partner visa. 
Applicants should be considered high net worth clients with a strong net asset and cash flow 
position. 
Non-resident self-employed, overseas company or business borrowers, companies or trusts in 
Australia where directors / trustees are living & working overseas, or non-resident guarantors 
are not acceptable. 
Cash out / equity release is not available. 
Other restrictions for lending to non-resident borrowers may be imposed by Firstmac from time 
to time.

8.1.1 Maximum loan amount / LVR 
Refer Maximum LVR & Loan Amounts by Postcode location. 
8.1.2 Income & Employment - PAYG 
The standard income and employment policies apply to non-resident borrowers. In addition, 
acceptable income evidence should also be translated into English and converted to Australian 
dollars at current exchange rate. 
Maximum of 90% of overseas sourced income (converted to Australian dollars) may be used for 
assessing serviceability.  
8.1.3 Serviceability 
Standard Serviceability calculations are to be used (refer Loan serviceability calculation), 
including living expenses, and all ongoing commitments/expenses (including those incurred 
overseas). 
8.1.4 Additional requirements 
• Where applicable, written evidence of Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) approval 
is required 
• Non-resident borrowers must have a bank account with an Australian bank in Australia 
into which rental payments are made and from which loan repayments can be drawn. 
An offset sub-account with the new loan will be sufficient to meet this requirement. 
9 Credit reports 
A Credit report through Equifax must be obtained for each borrower and guarantor (individuals 
& companies). Where the borrower is a trust, a credit report for the trust is not applicable 
however a credit report on each trustee is required.  
The credit report obtained must be a comprehensive credit report that includes the Equifax 
score, and for individuals, must include both consumer & commercial details.  
The Credit report can only be performed when a Privacy Act Authority is held for that person or 
entity. Originator/Mortgage Managers must ensure every borrower and guarantor has provided 
consent via a fully completed Privacy Act Authority prior to obtaining a credit report and/or 
submitting an application to Firstmac.  
Substantial penalties apply to both individuals and companies for misuse of the Credit reporting 
system under the provisions of the Privacy Act. 
A Credit Report issued within the last 90 days should be held at time of final credit assessment 
by Firstmac. 
9.1 Reviewing Credit Reports 
All Credit reports must be reviewed to determine the age of the credit file, the Equifax score, 
and identify any possible match files, directorships / business names, or adverse listings. 

 
18 
Firstmac Limited ABN 59 094 145 963 
AFSL/Australian Credit Licence 290600 
 
All financial details in the credit report must be reviewed including ‘Credit enquiries’ and 
‘Accounts & repayments’ (comprehensive credit reporting data provided by contributing credit 
providers), and compared to the borrower stated liabilities. 
9.2 Age of credit report 
Where an Equifax Credit file is new, or created within the last 6 months, additional steps should 
be taken to reconfirm the borrower’s full personal details and confirm their identity. Further 
discussion with borrower may be required to determine the reason for the new credit file.  
If the borrower is likely to have an existing credit file eg has other credit facilities, or recent 
change of name, additional checks are to be completed to locate that existing credit file. 
9.3 Multiple names or a ‘possible match’ 
There may be instances where a borrower has more than one name eg following marriage, or 
divorce. If the borrower has more than one Equifax file number, a credit check on all Equifax file 
numbers should be conducted.  
There are occasions where a ‘possible match’ is identified by Equifax. Further investigation 
should be conducted to determine if the ‘possible match’ is the borrower, and if so, obtain a 
credit report on the ‘possible match’ file. 
9.4 Directorships on individual’s credit report 
Where an individual borrower or guarantor credit report shows they are a current director of a 
company, and the company is a source of income needed for serviceability, a credit report is 
required that company. 
Reports are not required for a company where: 
• the individual is noted as a previous director;  
• no reliance on income from the company to support serviceability (unless there are 
indications the company may have adverse credit history). 
Where a current directorship is shown on credit report, and the company is not a source of 
income needed for serviceability, enquiries should be made to confirm the trading status of the 
company.  
Verbal or written (eg email) confirmation should be obtained from the Borrower stating the 
company is able to meet all commitments & expenses from its own cash flow and without 
reliance on their individual income. If it is confirmed that the individual is supporting the 
company commitments from their current employment income, this will need to be taken into 
account when assessing serviceability. 
9.5 Review of previous enquiries on Equifax credit report 
High volume of credit enquiry may indicate greater likelihood of an unfavorable event, such as a 
default, being recorded on a credit file. 

 
19 
Firstmac Limited ABN 59 094 145 963 
AFSL/Australian Credit Licence 290600 
 
Each Equifax credit report is to be reviewed to identify any undisclosed or under disclosed 
debts, by comparing details of the credit report against Assets & Liabilities statement on the 
loan application. Unmatched loans details are to be investigated / discussed with the borrower. 
Loans requiring LMI – regardless of the Equifax Score, as a minimum, all credit enquiries within 
the last 12 months are to be queried and compared against Assets & Liabilities statement on 
the loan application. Unmatched enquiries are to be investigated / discussed with the 
borrower. A notation is to be made for each enquiry listed, confirming the outcome of the 
enquiry. Where an application has not proceeded, or been declined, the reason is to be 
provided. 
9.6 Credit History 
Firstmac considers borrowers with any history of financial defaults (ie default listed by a credit 
provider), non-financial defaults that do not meet the criteria below, court writs, petitions, and 
bankruptcies, to be high risk and the application will be declined.  
Non-financial defaults (ie default list by telco or utility provider only) may be considered subject 
to: 
• Default was not listed by a financial institution (ie will only consider Telco / Utility); and  
• Default amount does not exceed $1,000; and 
• Credit report is updated to show default as paid, or evidence the default is paid in full 
from the lister; and 
• A reasonable explanation is provided in writing from borrower detailing the 
circumstances 
9.7 Ban period 
Individuals may request Equifax to place a Ban Period on their credit file due to concerns 
regarding fraud. Where a credit report is attempted on a credit file with a current Ban Period, 
Equifax will return a message indicating a ban is in place and the credit report will not be 
provided. A loan assessment cannot be completed until the ban period ends and a complete 
credit report is received. 
10 Employment and income 
Employment should be considered ongoing and stable. The following table describes the types 
of employment and minimum term that is acceptable.  
While consideration may be given to applicants with short term current employment, and / or 
applicants on probation, the type of employment and reasons for recent employment change 
needs to be investigated to mitigate and support acceptance.

• where they have management control of the company 
Example: 
A husband and wife running their business through a company structure and paying themselves 
wages from that business are considered self-employed, although, technically, they are PAYG 
income earners by virtue of the fact that they receive wages. However, because they are the 
owners of the business and have management control of the company, they are considered 
self-employed.  
Applicants are considered self-employed if they are engaged as:  
•  sub-contractors (common in the building and transport industries)  
•  professional consultants (common in the IT and Professional Services industries)  
•  operate a company structure in which they are “employed”

business income is to ensure the company is trading 
profitably & can continue to meet ongoing commitments, 
including the income paid to the individual borrower that 
is relied on for serviceability eg dividends; directors fee; 
etc. Company NPBT is not relied on for serviceability of a 
loan in the individual’s names.

Rental income – 
residential property 
Up to 80% 
If multiple sources of evidence are provided, higher 
actual rent received may be used if the property is rented 
through a real estate agent with a copy of a current 
tenancy agreement or rental statements provided. 
Otherwise, the lowest rental amount should be used. 
% of rental income used for serviceability may be 
reduced, or excluded from serviceability, where the 
rental income is considered volatile (eg student 
accommodation; inflated rent due to lack of rental 
property in an area; reduced rent due to oversupply of 
rental property in an area; local economy influenced by 
mining industry; etc). 
Residential property: 
• 
80% of confirmed gross rental income for a 
standard residential tenancy

12 Confirmation of debts 
12.1 Non-disclosure of debts  
Non-disclosure of debt may sometimes be identified when investigating credit report enquiries, 
or other supporting documentation provided 
Non-disclosure of debts should be viewed on an individual basis, as sometimes they are a 
genuine oversight, however non-disclosure of debts may result in the loan being declined or an 
approval being withdrawn.  
12.2 Current debt position  
Mortgage loans should be listed individually on the asset and liability statement identifying 
property address, lender, loan amount and repayments.  
Line of Credit Facilities, Personal Loans, Leases and Hire Purchase agreements, and Credit Card 
limits should be listed individually on the asset and liability statement and include the lender, 
loan amount and repayments. 
12.3 Council rates, body corporate charges, other statutory charges  
For loans requiring LMI, where an existing debt is being refinanced or a further advance is 
provided, the borrower should provide evidence that all rates, statutory charges (land tax, 
water rates etc) and body corporate charges where applicable are up to date.  
13 Savings history and proof of deposit and source  
13.1 Evidence of funds to complete  
The source of funds to complete the transaction must be clearly identified on the application. 
In some instances, additional information may be required as to the actual source of the funds 
eg may be from sale of a property or borrowed funds.  
For loans with LVR > 80%, evidence such as bank statements, security deposit receipts etc. is to 
be provided with the application. 
13.2 Gifted funds  
Gifted funds from an immediate family member (ie parents, grandparents, siblings or children 
of the borrower) are generally acceptable as part of the borrower’s equity. Gifted funds may 
form the balance of the required funds to complete, or may be used towards legal fees.  
The borrower must provide a written statement from the person/s gifting the funds declaring 
that it is a true gift and not repayable. For loans requiring LMI, the written statement must be a 
statutory declaration. 
If the gifted funds are repayable, full terms of the arrangement must be included in the written 
statement and included in serviceability calculations where applicable.  
Evidence of the source of the gifted funds may also be requested.

13.3 First Home Owners Grant (FHOG)  
Firstmac are accredited to process FHOG applications. To process, the fully completed and 
signed original FHOG application, as well as certified copies with the completed Customer 
Identification Checklist are required. 
Mortgage Insurers may assess FHOG loans on different ratios and guidelines.  
14 Assessing the ability to repay 
Establishing the borrower’s true debt servicing capacity is vital to assessing ability to repay. It is 
not in the best interests of the borrower, or Firstmac, to take on more debt than they can 
manage.  
If the borrower cannot demonstrate an ability to repay, the application would not normally be 
approved.  
Only in clearly justifiable circumstances should the application be considered based wholly or 
partly on the repayment capacity of a guarantor (refer section Third party 
mortgages/guarantees). Such circumstances may arise where borrowers have taken action to 
safeguard their assets in case of professional negligence claims. These actions can include:  
• dissemination of income to family members;  
• diversion of funds to related business entities.  
This can lead to loan applications where the borrower has little or no income. Instead, the 
borrower offers a guarantee by another person (must be common law spouses), or for loans to 
companies a related business (directors / shareholder must be the applicant and / or common 
law spouse), in support of the borrowing. In these circumstances, the guarantor must obtain 
independent legal advice.  
When assessing loan applications supported by a guarantee, the guarantor must have the 
ability to meet the borrower's commitments in the event of the borrower defaulting. 
Guarantors are to be assessed in the same way as primary borrowers.  
When assessing an application, ensure that:  
• any tax minimisation activity is clearly legal;  
• the source of income is clearly legal;  
• there is a clear benefit in the transaction to the borrower and to any guarantor.  
A person must not be included as a borrower or a guarantor to a loan merely to add weight to 
the loan application eg borrower of convenience.

15 Loan serviceability calculation 
Firstmac uses the Net Disposable Income (NDI) method to assess a borrower’s ability to meet 
regular fixed commitments. The NDI ratio is the ratio of net disposable income (after tax and 
living costs) to total fixed commitments.  
Serviceability is to be calculated using the Firstmac Servicing Calculator with minimum NDI 
1.00:1 required. 
Loans requiring LMI – the relevant LMI’s serviceability calculator is to be used, however a 
minimum NDI of 1.00:1 must also be demonstrated on the Firstmac Servicing Calculator. 
The deductions for total monthly commitments should include the following items:  
• All regular debt repayment commitments (for Line of Credit loans, assume the loan is 
drawn to the credit limit)  
• Rent / board (may be excluded if ceasing on loan approval; if board is ongoing, refer 
notional rental expense section of this policy)  
• Any other fixed regular monthly commitments such as HELP/HECS debt repayments; 
Child Support etc (to be shown as a liability, not a living expense) 
• Minimum of 3.227% on the total credit card limit (equivalent to repaying the fully drawn 
limit over a 3 year term) 
• Living expenses/costs (refer Living Expenses) 
• Other discretionary commitments (these vary according to a borrower’s circumstances; 
any material items should be considered and taken into account in assessing). 
15.1 Firstmac Serviceability Assessment Rate 
The Firstmac Serviceability Assessment Rate (ie default servicing rate) for variable rate loans, 
and new loans with a fixed interest rate period of less than 5 years, incudes an assessment rate 
buffer to allow for future interest rate movements and / or unexpected expenses.  
The Firstmac Assessment Rate applied in servicing is: 
• New lending: 
o Loan splits that have a variable interest rate, or a fixed rate term of < 5years – 
the higher of (1) the weighted average interest rate of total loan being sought 
plus an assessment rate buffer of 2.00% pa; or (2) the assessment rate floor of 
6.25% pa. 
o Loan splits that have a fixed rate term of 5 years – the actual rate is used as the 
assessment rate, with no buffer or floor rate applied.  
 
 

 
35 
Firstmac Limited ABN 59 094 145 963 
AFSL/Australian Credit Licence 290600 
 
• Existing settled / ongoing loans (other lenders) 
o Firstmac funded loans – the higher of (1) actual loan rate + an assessment rate 
buffer of 2.00% pa; or (2) the assessment rate floor of 6.25% pa.  
o Other financial institution (OFI) loans – assessment rate 8.25% pa 
• Investment loan interest addback – where no OFI investment loans are held, the same 
assessment rate as new lending is used to calculate the investment loan interest add-
back; otherwise, the lower of the assessment rate for new lending and the OFI 
assessment rate is used. 
15.2 Proposed and ongoing home loan repayments 
For servicing, a Principal and Interest (P&I) repayment is calculated for the new proposed loan 
amount, and all ongoing home loans held by the borrower with Firstmac, and other financial 
institutions. 
For loans with Interest Only (IO) repayments, the Principal and Interest (P&I) repayment is 
calculated using the residual Principal and Interest (P&I) loan term eg for a 30 year loan term 
with IO repayments for the first 5 years, the P&I repayment is calculated over the residual P&I 
term of 25 years.  
15.2.1 New loan amount 
The Principal and Interest (P&I) repayment for the new loan amount is calculated using the 
Firstmac Assessment Rate, and a loan term determined by the repayment type selected for 
each loan split / portion of the new loan: 
• Principal & Interest (P&I) portion – proposed repayments calculated using the actual 
loan term  
• Interest Only (IO) portion – proposed repayments calculated using the remaining P&I 
loan term ie the actual loan term less the IO period  
15.2.2 Ongoing home loans – Firstmac and other financial institutions 
P&I repayments for all ongoing home loans held by the borrower, with Firstmac and other 
financial institutions is calculated using: 
• Assessment Rate applicable to the application;  
• The loan amount shown in the A&L, which is to include the loan balance + the amount 
available to redraw on the loan; 
• A default loan term based on the repayment type: 
o P&I = 30 year loan  
o IO = 25 years

15.3 Living Expenses 
The cost of living may vary based on the borrower’s household and / or family unit. Reasonable 
enquiries are to be made about a borrower’s variable living expense, and are to include the 
amount the borrower spends on: 
• General Living Expense –basic essential items such as groceries, clothing, utilities, 
phone/mobile, internet, motor vehicle/transport, rates, general insurance (car / home), 
basic education costs for dependents; and 
• Education fees / costs – additional education costs for dependents eg private school 
fees; and 
• Childcare – out of pocket expenses associated with childcare; and 
• Private Health Cover   
15.3.1 Household Expenditure Measure (HEM) 
The Household Expenditure Measure (HEM) will be used as a guide for the comparison of 
general living expenses as stated by the borrower.  
HEM data is subscribed through and provided by the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic 
and Social Research, Melbourne. 
The HEM method adopted is based on the borrower’s ‘geographic location’ (ie where the 
borrower lives in a Capital city, or not) and ‘household income’ (income bands).  
15.3.2 Living expenses used for serviceability calculations 
The Firstmac Servicing Calculator automatically calculates the total living expense to be applied 
based on the amounts entered, and adopts the higher of: 
• The total of the borrower stated ‘General living expense + Childcare’ or ‘HEM living 
allowance’, whichever is higher;  
PLUS 
• ‘Educations fees/costs’, ‘Private health cover’ & ‘Other living expenses’ 
15.4 Notional Rental Expense  
Where the borrower is purchasing an investment property, and is boarding with family 
(including parents) or friends either rent-free or at an unusually low cost, a notional rental 
expense may be applied. 
• ‘Boarding’ with 3rd party who is not the Applicant’s spouse/partner as described below, 
higher of borrower stated board / rent expense or notional rental expense below is to 
be applied: 
o $500 / month for a Single – in addition to standard living allowance, existing 
commitments etc. 
o $650 / month for a Couple – in addition to standard living allowance, existing 
commitments etc. 

 
37 
Firstmac Limited ABN 59 094 145 963 
AFSL/Australian Credit Licence 290600 
 
• 
‘Living with spouse/partner’ – where a sole applicant living with spouse/partner who is 
not an applicant, where the rent expense/mortgage payment for the property they are 
living in is in the spouse/partner’s name only, notional rental expense does not need to 
be applied.  
15.5 Joint income and joint commitments 
Where the borrower has existing joint commitments with other parties who are not part of the 
loan application, 100% of the existing commitment is to be included in calculating serviceability 
for the new loan. 
If the borrower shares a positive income source (other than from a joint investment property 
that has a corresponding investment loan) with parties who are not part of the loan application, 
the borrower’s ownership percentage will be applied to the gross joint income. Evidence may 
be required to ascertain the ownership percentage. 
15.5.1 Joint investment property with non-applicant 
If the borrower shares an investment property and corresponding investment loan with parties 
who are not part of the loan application: 
• 100% of the investment loan repayment must be included in serviceability;  
• 100% of the rental income can be used in serviceability; 
• Borrower’s percentage ownership is to be applied to the investment loan interest 
addback calculation.  
Where there is no corresponding joint investment debt, the borrower’s ownership percentage 
is to be applied to the rental income.  
Evidence may be required to ascertain the ownership percentage. 
15.6 Borrower with a non-applicant spouse / partner 
Where a borrower is the sole applicant on a loan, and has a spouse / partner who is not an 
applicant, full household living expenses are to be obtained from the borrower.  
Where the non-applicant spouse / partner has income that is used to contribute to household 
living expenses and commitments, consideration may be given to include that income to 
demonstrate serviceability, provided there is a reasonable explanation for the loan structure 
(eg Accountant recommendation to maximise taxation benefits; Legal advice for asset 
protection; property owned prior to relationship). 
This approach is at the discretion of Firstmac Credit and in some cases, may be more 
appropriate to include the non-applicant spouse as a borrower.  
When including non-applicant spouse’s income for serviceability, full details of the non-
applicant spouse’s employment history and income are to be obtained, and must meet 
standard employment and income acceptability criteria (including time in current employment). 
Standard supporting documentation to confirm income and employment is required. 

 
38 
Firstmac Limited ABN 59 094 145 963 
AFSL/Australian Credit Licence 290600 
 
All ongoing liabilities and commitments held in the applicant’s name solely, jointly with the 
non-applicant spouse, or in non-applicant spouse’s name solely, must be disclosed. 
16 Security 
All loans must be secured by registered first mortgages over acceptable real property, which 
includes Torrens Title, Strata Title / Community Title, Common Law, and Crown leasehold 
(providing the lease runs for at least 5 years past the maturity date of a loan).   
Security properties must be for residential use and must be in good condition, free of defects, 
well presented and readily saleable. Acceptable security includes houses; home units; flats; 
apartments; town houses and villas; and vacant land with a signed fixed cost building contract. 
Units/Apartments – where car spaces or garages attached to a unit/apartment are on a 
different title to the actual residence, a first mortgage over the additional title for the car space 
or garage must also be taken. 
16.1 Geographic location 
Security properties can be considered within all states and territories of Australia. The 
maximum loan amount / LVR is determined by the postcode classification shown in the shown 
in the Firstmac Acceptable Security location guide (refer section Loan amount). 
Security in a postcode not listed in the Firstmac Acceptable Security location guide, will be 
considered on a case by case basis, and may be subject to LMI approval. 
Firstmac may impose additional restrictions on certain postcodes from time to time.  
16.2 Security concentration 
Firstmac may impose a restriction on the number of properties accepted as security in any one 
(1) development, street, suburb or postcode, to limit concentration of exposure. Any such 
restriction will be considered on a case by case basis. 
16.3 Concentration limit 
As part of risk management, Firstmac may set prudential concentration limits (eg on individual 
projects, developments or buildings, areas) to help monitor and manage exposures in line with 
business objectives. Concentration limits may be set on security type (e.g. vertical/horizontal 
development), geographic location, and product. 
16.4 Unacceptable securities 
• Income producing properties, including but not limited to, rural properties or farms, 
backpacker hostels or boarding houses 
• Properties not connected to water (except in clearly recognized urban areas) and / or 
national electricity grid

16.5 High Density apartments / units 
A High Density unit is a strata titled home unit or apartment in a development comprising more 
than 6 floors that is in a postcode classified as High Density postcodes as per the Firstmac 
Acceptable Security Location guide.  
The following apply to these types of security:  
• Minimum floor size of 50sqm (40sqm in metropolitan locations) in living area, excluding 
balconies and car space 
• Valuation should include comparable sales outside the development, and details of any 
resales within the development  
• Maximum LVR 80% (additional LVR and concentration restrictions may apply to 
individual developments) 
• Home unit or apartment developments comprising 6 floors or less are not defined as 
high density, regardless of whether they are in a high density postcode, or not 
16.6 Off-the-Plan purchases – revaluation and increased borrowing at settlement 
A final valuation confirming property is fully complete is required prior to settlement of 
properties purchased off-the-plan. 
Firstmac recognises that an off-the-plan purchase may present a situation where the borrower 
seeks to increase borrowing (at the time of settlement) in the light of an improved valuation of 
the subject property.  
The increased loan amount requested must not exceed the purchase price as per the original 
contract of sale.  
Normal lending criteria will apply (specifically, re-application and assessment for the increase) 
but the following additional criteria in respect to the revaluation and request will also apply. 
16.6.1 Period of time from exchange of purchase contract to settlement for purchase  
The settlement for the purchase (and increased borrowing) must be at least 12 months from 
the exchange of contract to purchase.  
16.6.2 Valuation – increased borrowings 
An updated valuation will be required to support the application for increased borrowing. The 
valuation must specifically address comparable sales external to the subject. For a valuation to 
be acceptable, it must be less than 90 days old. This requirement applies to additional loans and 
variations. 
16.6.3 LVR (Lending Value Ratio) 
The LVR may be based on the updated valuation figure. Where loans are mortgage insured, 
they must be in line with Mortgage Insurer policy with respect to such lending. All other policy 
terms and conditions for the lending remain unchanged.

16.7 Multiple dwellings on single title / dual occupancy 
Dual occupancy properties in which no more than two residential dwellings are held on one 
certificate of title may be considered. The dwellings may be ‘in line’ such as a duplex, or 
separate dwellings. Where the property is a duplex, or a primary unit with attached auxiliary 
unit, the minimum living area for each unit should be 50 square metres. 
The valuation report must include comparable sales of other dual occupancy properties in the 
area within the last 6 months.   
16.8 Display Home 
It is not unusual for a builder/developer to construct a display home for marketing and 
advertising purposes and subsequently sell the property to an investor on a lease back 
arrangement. Where display homes are being considered as an exception, the following 
applies: 
• Display home located in NSW, or in a ‘display village’ in any state or territory, are 
excluded 
• Any restrictive zoning or covenants, or any other restriction on the sale or renting, 
location of the property must be assessed and acceptable to Firstmac 
• Detailed information on restrictions and/or covenants on the property 
• Maximum LVR is 80% 
• Mortgage insurance may be required 
• There must be sufficient mitigants to support a display home and the valuation report 
must include comments regarding the terms of the lease back arrangement 
• Rental income used for serviceability may be limited to the amount that would be 
achieved under a standard residential tenancy agreement. 
16.9 Relocatable Home 
This type of security is where an existing dwelling is purchased and then relocated onto another 
block of land. Firstmac consider relocatable homes to be acceptable under standard policy 
however, an assessment of a relocatable home cannot be completed until the property has 
been installed in the new location and services connected, with evidence property complies 
with Local Government Authority requirements to be provided. 
16.10 Units in developments subject to a management agreement/letting pool 
Security property located in developments which are subject to a management agreement / 
letting pool may be considered, provided it is not resort/hotel accommodation aimed at holiday 
makers, can be removed from the management agreement/letting pool and permanently 
occupied (owner occupied or residential lease agreement). 
If the security property has a managed and / or pooled rental agreement, the valuation must be 
on the basis of vacant possession, without taking in to account the serviced apartment lease or 
furniture packages. The Valuer comments must acknowledge the lease agreement in place and 

 
42 
Firstmac Limited ABN 59 094 145 963 
AFSL/Australian Credit Licence 290600 
 
specifically identify / provide details of provision for borrowers to remove the property from 
the rental pool, and whether the property can be permanently occupied (owner occupied or 
residential lease agreement). 
16.11 Sales without the intervention of an agent  
Sale of a property without the intervention of an agent is considered to be an arm’s length 
transaction provided there is no relationship between the vendor and the purchaser. 
Firstmac will consider loans for purchases where there is no agent involved in the sale provided 
the valuer has commented within the valuation report acknowledging awareness of the terms 
of the sale and that the valuation represents fair market value as defined by the memorandum 
upon which the API pro-forma valuation is based.  
16.12 Non-arm’s length transactions 
Relates to the sale of a property where there is a relationship between the parties (purchaser 
and vendor). 
This includes advantageous/favourable purchases from a family member at a discounted price 
or where a vendor is selling the property at a discounted price to a person to whom he/she is 
indebted. 
Firstmac will consider loans for non-arm’s length transactions, provided the valuer has 
commented within the valuation report acknowledging the relationship between the parties, 
awareness of the terms of the sale and that the valuation represents fair market value as 
defined by the memorandum upon which the API pro-forma valuation is based.  
For advantageous/favourable purchases from a family member, the LVR may be calculated on 
the market value shown in the valuation report however the loan amount should not exceed 
the purchase price of the property. Where there is no formal contract of sale, the ‘purchase 
price’ will be based on the consideration amount shown on Transfer documentation, or other 
documentation provided to support the transfer of ownership eg Family Law Court Agreement. 
17 Security Valuations 
An acceptable valuation is required for all security properties.  
The following valuation types are acceptable subject to eligibility and acceptability criteria: 
• AVM (Automated Valuation Model) 
• EVR Desktop 
• Full valuation  
AVM is not available for SMSF loans; AVM and Desktop valuations are not available for 
Construction loans, security in new estates or off the plan, or any loan requiring LMI. 

 
43 
Firstmac Limited ABN 59 094 145 963 
AFSL/Australian Credit Licence 290600 
 
17.1 AVM  
AVM is an automated valuation model, provided by Corelogic (ValEx) using various data inputs 
and analytics to provide an assessed value of the security property on the specified date.  
The AVM results include a value range, an AVM Value (based on the mid-point of the range), 
and an FSD (Forecast Standard Deviation).  
The FSD represents the probability that the AVM Value will be +/- the FSD% of the sale value. 
The lower the FSD, the more accurate the AVM value should be relative to the final market 
value. 
17.1.1 AVM Eligibility & Acceptability criteria 
• Security located in Category 1a and 1b as per the Firstmac Acceptable Security Location 
list. 
• Maximum security Value: 
House/ Unit / townhouse in NSW or VIC 
$1,500,000 per security 
House / Unit / townhouse in all other 
States / Territories 
$1,250,000 per security 
 
• Maximum LVR and FSD: 
o Maximum LVR 80% with FSD < 10% 
o Maximum LVR 78% with FSD < 12% 
o Maximum LVR 75% with FSD < 15% 
• Refinance – AVM value adopted as market value 
• Purchase – Contract of Sale purchase price adopted as market value where validated by 
AVM ie purchase price to be within Upper and Lower range shown on AVM 
17.2 EVR Desktop 
EVR Desktop must be prepared by a registered licensed valuer acceptable to Firstmac. The 
valuer assesses the market value through local knowledge of the security location, information 
available through data sources, and other research methods adopted by the valuer, without 
physically inspecting the property. 
A valuer may deem an EVR Desktop valuation is not suitable due to lack of data and recent 
imagery available on the subject property and surrounding sales; or the property may have 
characteristics which would make it ‘unusual’ in relation to other properties in surrounding 
area. In these cases, a full valuation is required. 
17.2.1 EVR / Desktop Eligibility & Acceptability criteria 
• Security located in Category 1a and 1b as per the Firstmac Acceptable Security Location 
list 

 
44 
Firstmac Limited ABN 59 094 145 963 
AFSL/Australian Credit Licence 290600 
 
• Maximum security Value: 
House/ Unit / townhouse in NSW or VIC 
$1,500,000 per security 
House/ Unit / townhouse in all other 
States / Territories 
$1,250,000 per security 
 
• Maximum LVR 80% for home loan (refinance & purchase) 
• Maximum LVR 70% for SMSF loans with residential security 
17.3 Full Valuation report 
Where the AVM or Desktop criteria is not met, a Full Valuation is required.  
The valuation report must be for mortgage lending/security purposes and must be performed 
by a registered licensed valuer acceptable to Firstmac and the Lender’s Mortgage Insurers. 
Valuations must comply with the valuation standards as set out in Annexure 2. 
Generally, Firstmac will not accept valuation reports more than 90 days old (from the date of 
inspection) for final assessment of a loan, but may consider exceptions to this policy upon 
application, with the consent of the Lender’s Mortgage Insurer, where applicable.  
The valuation report for each security must be no more than 180 days old (from the date of 
inspection) at settlement. 
The valuation must be addressed to “First Mortgage Company Home Loans Pty Ltd” or the 
appropriate Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) if there is one applicable.  
The valuation must also note that the valuation can be relied upon by:  
• Firstmac Limited 
• Firstmac Assets Pty Ltd and its associated entities 
• Firstmac Fiduciary Services Pty Ltd 
• Helia Insurance Pty Ltd 
• QBE Lenders’ Mortgage Insurance Limited  
and the respective related companies of these insurers, as advised. 
Where applicable, approved Valuers should be advised of any inducements associated with the 
purchase and asked to provide relevant comment. Such inducements may be in the form of 
rental guarantees from the vendor, subsidisation of costs such as stamp duty or legal fees being 
included in the purchase price, trade dollars, or rebates. 
The valuation report should be reviewed carefully to ensure:  
• The valuation report is assigned to the relevant interest parties  
• The borrower(s) name(s) is / are spelled correctly  
• The security property address is correct  

 
45 
Firstmac Limited ABN 59 094 145 963 
AFSL/Australian Credit Licence 290600 
 
• The security property details are acceptable including house type; land size; description; 
covenants to title; easements; land fill; local government zoning and any adverse 
features raised by the valuer 
• The valuation is signed and dated by a qualified valuer. The valuation should provide 
details as outlined in the Australian Property Institute (API) PropertyPRO Pro-forma 
Report (a copy can be obtained from Firstmac Credit).  
If a valuation is conditional upon a certain requirement e.g. a survey report or pest inspection, 
this requirement must be satisfied.  
The valuation report is not to be provided to any third party e.g. a broker or the borrower/s, as 
the valuation is for mortgagee purposes only. 
17.4 Valuation variation - acknowledgement by proposed borrower(s) 
Firstmac recognises that situations do arise where valuations on properties offered as security 
may vary downwards against the purchase price.  
In these instances, full and open disclosure of the situation must be made to the borrower 
(excepting the amount of the valuation, which must remain confidential so as not to breach 
engagement terms of the Valuer) and the borrower’s instructions sought on whether to 
proceed with the proposed loan, given that other loan assessment criteria has been satisfied.  
A valuation variation is deemed to occur when the purchase price is 10% or more above the 
valuation amount of the proposed security 
Upon receipt of a valuation which falls within the above category, the Originator / Mortgage 
Manager must immediately inform the proposed borrower in writing advising the following: 
• The lender’s valuation has produced a variation below the purchase price.  
• The lender is still willing to lend (subject to other successful lending criteria).  
• The borrower should be encouraged to make their own enquires about the value of the 
property.  
• The borrower must acknowledge the variation by signing a Valuation Variation 
Acknowledgement prior to settlement to signify that they acknowledge the variation 
and still wish to proceed with the loan.  
The valuation amount must not be quoted to the borrower as the valuation is for lending 
purposes only and is addressed to the lender and associated parties.  
A template of the Valuation Variation Acknowledgement is provided in Annexure 1.  
The borrower acknowledgement of the valuation variation is to form an integral part of the 
loan documentation and as such must be a condition of Firstmac loan approval.  
17.5 Builder / Developer Sales in Queensland – Form 8 
The Property Occupations Form 8 forms part of the contract of sale for Queensland 
contracts.  The Form 8 deals only with Agent’s disclosed referrals and benefits received.  

 
46 
Firstmac Limited ABN 59 094 145 963 
AFSL/Australian Credit Licence 290600 
 
Where applicable, the fully completed Form 8 included with the full copy of contract of sale is 
to be provided to the Valuer. The Valuer is to confirm in the valuation report that they have 
sighted the Form 8 and acknowledge the benefit or value noted in the disclosure to prospective 
buyer. 
17.6 Valuation panel 
For a valuer to be accredited and approved, valuers must be registered with either the Real 
Estate Valuers Registration Board or the Australian Property Institute Inc.  
All panel valuers must comply with Firstmac’s minimum valuation requirements as well as the 
requirements of the specific mortgage insurers – refer to Annexure 2 Firstmac Valuation 
Standards and Valuer Accreditation for full details. 
Valuers are required to provide written confirmation of their registration/licensing 
arrangements together with evidence of an acceptable level of current Professional Indemnity 
Cover.  
Valuers must only value properties located within the geographic areas in which they operate.  
Firstmac reserves the right to restrict the number of valuers on the panel but will work with 
Originators/Mortgage Managers to ensure that there are sufficient valuers on the panel to 
meet the needs of the Originator/Mortgage Managers.  
18 Loan purpose 
Applicants must provide full details of the loan purpose to assist in the determination of the 
loan’s status to ensure responsibilities NCCP are met. 
The stated purpose must align with the proposed loan amount and all other aspects of the loan. 
Full details regarding the proposed use of the funds provided must be clearly stated in the 
application in all cases – simply stating “future investment” or “personal use” without further 
context is not sufficient.  
Additional documentary evidence may be required to support the stated loan purpose and 
Firstmac reserves the right, to control the disbursement of loan proceeds in accordance with 
the stated purpose. 
18.1 Purchase owner occupied or investment residential property 
Purchase of new (fully completed prior to settlement) or existing dwellings to be used for 
owner occupied or investment purposes.  
Purchase of vacant land will only be considered with a fixed price building contract, as a 
construction loan. 
18.2 Construction loans  
Construction loans are available where the purpose of the loan includes: 

 
47 
Firstmac Limited ABN 59 094 145 963 
AFSL/Australian Credit Licence 290600 
 
• purchase or refinance of vacant land with a fixed price building contract for construction 
of a residential dwelling in place at time of application;  
or 
• major or structural renovations, or other improvements to the property held as security 
where the property is valued on an ‘as if complete’ basis (may include refinance, prior to 
commencement of construction / renovations).  
Construction may only be undertaken by a licensed / registered builder. Owner builders are not 
acceptable.  
Progress valuations are undertaken at each stage of construction where a drawdown of the 
loan is requested.  
The borrower’s contribution toward the fixed-price building contract, and / or any extras / 
variations, are to be paid by the borrower from their own funds prior to payment of any claims 
for progress draws from the loan.  
Firstmac will retain sufficient funds to complete construction (ie cost to complete), as estimated 
by Firstmac’s valuer, irrespective of the progress payment schedule and / or the wording of the 
building contract.  
For owner occupation construction, Firstmac will require an occupancy certificate and the 
owners may be allowed to complete items such as driveways and landscaping at their own 
expense subject to provision of reasonable written quotes. The valuation will need to be based 
on land cost/value and total construction costs, including the above items.  
For investment property construction, Firstmac will require a building construction contract to 
be on a full ‘’turnkey’’ basis, able to be occupied immediately on completion.  
The construction period is limited to a period of 12 months from settlement date. If 
construction is not completed within 12 months of the settlement date, an additional 0.50%pa 
will be applied to the construction variable interest rate applicable to the loan at the time.  
A maximum of 5% of the fixed-price building contract may be released to the builder for the 
deposit at settlement of the land (all states except WA). In WA, a maximum of 6.5% of the 
fixed-price building contract may be released. 
Prior to the first drawdown Firstmac require: 
• Copies of the plans approved by the relevant Local Authority  
• Evidence of Builders registration / license and contractors insurance 
• Builders fire and general insurance 
• The signed final building contract. 
Prior to final drawdown, Firstmac require:  
• Certificate of Occupancy from the relevant Local Authority or council  

 
48 
Firstmac Limited ABN 59 094 145 963 
AFSL/Australian Credit Licence 290600 
 
Split options and redraws are not available on construction loans. 
The construction loan will revert to a standard home loan product once construction is fully 
complete and the loan is fully drawn.  
18.3 Home renovations / improvements 
Where the loan purpose includes an amount for non-structural home renovations or 
improvements, provided the current ‘’as is valuation’’ of the security property can support the 
proposed amount within current LVR policy, loan draw-downs for these renovations or 
improvements may not need to be controlled by Firstmac. 
A construction loan is to be considered where: 
• The security property needs to be valued on an ‘as if complete’ basis to support the 
proposed amount within current LVR policy;  
or 
• The security property ‘as is’ value is sufficient to support the proposed amount within 
current LVR policy and the value of work to be completed is > $100,000.  
18.4 Refinance existing owner occupied or investment residential property loans  
Loans to refinance existing loans from other lenders are acceptable however, good conduct of 
the credit facility being refinanced is expected. 
Comprehensive credit reporting and the borrower’s Equifax score is relied on to support 
satisfactory repayment history of loans being refinanced, in lieu of refinance statements.  
Refinance statements are not required where all borrowers on an application have an Equifax 
score satisfactory to Firstmac, and the borrower’s credit report shows either no defaults, or 
non-financial default that meets the criteria shown in Credit History. 
18.5 Personal debt consolidation  
Loans to consolidate personal debt from other lenders are acceptable however, good conduct 
of the credit facilities being consolidated is expected. 
Comprehensive credit reporting and the borrower’s Equifax score is relied on to support 
satisfactory repayment history of loans being refinanced, in lieu of refinance statements.  
Refinance statements are not required where all borrowers on an application have an Equifax 
score satisfactory to Firstmac, and the borrower’s credit report shows either no defaults, or 
non-financial default that meets the criteria shown in Credit History. 
18.6 Equity release / cash out   
Any loan, or part thereof, that is released / disbursed directly to the borrower is considered 
cash out, regardless of the proposed loan purpose.  

 
49 
Firstmac Limited ABN 59 094 145 963 
AFSL/Australian Credit Licence 290600 
 
The purpose of the use of funds must be clearly identified in all cases. Generic loan purposes 
such as Future Investment or Personal Use are unacceptable without additional detail from the 
borrower. 
For cash out amounts up to $100,000 with LVR < 80%, no further supporting documentary 
evidence for the use of funds is required where the borrower provides sufficient clear details 
relating to the proposed use of the funds.  
Where the cash out amount is > $100,000, additional documentation is required to evidence 
use of funds (eg contract of sale; quotes / invoices). Once acceptable evidence is provided to 
support the loan purpose, controlled disbursement is not required unless the loan approval is 
reliant on the funds being used specifically for that purpose e.g. funds to purchase rental 
property not taken as security & serviceability is reliant on the proposed rental income.  
Where the loan purpose is refinance, and borrower has redraw available in the home loan 
being refinanced, cash out to retain the redraw position currently held with the outgoing lender 
can be considered. Evidence of the current redraw position with the outgoing lender is to be 
provided if the amount is > $100,000, and the cash out amount should be disbursed to the new 
loan / offset sub-account at settlement. 
18.7 Business use 
Loans of up to $1,000,000 will be considered for the refinance of loans originally for business 
use; and up to $500,000 for other business purposes.  
Loans with LVR over 80% require LRF (subject to all criteria in Lender Risk Fee (LRF) – LVR > 80% 
and < 90% being met) LMI (all relevant LMI criteria to apply). 
Borrowers require a minimum of two (2) years self-employment in existing business.  
If income from a business being purchased is required to support the loan, the business must 
have been operating for a minimum of two (2) years. Income is to be supported by the last two 
(2) years financial statements. 
Acceptable Loan Purposes for Business Loans: 
• Refinance an existing business loan, or part of an existing business loan 
• Purchase of plant and equipment 
• Purchase of an existing business 
• Working capital < $50,000  
Unacceptable Loan Purposes for Business Loans: 
• Repayment of shareholder/director loans  
18.8 Any other legal purpose 
Loan purposes related to consumer goods and services; travel and holidays; household and 
personal goods; motor vehicles; any other worthwhile purpose may be considered at the sole 
discretion of Firstmac and Lender’s Mortgage Insurers (if applicable).  

 
50 
Firstmac Limited ABN 59 094 145 963 
AFSL/Australian Credit Licence 290600 
 
19 Loan amount 
The maximum loan amount for each application is dependent on the location of the security 
property and the number of security properties for that application.  
Where any application shares a common security with another application, the maximum loan 
amount is based on the total of those applications. 
Regardless of the number of securities, the total loan amount for a single application or 
multiple applications sharing any common security, is not to exceed $2,000,000. The Maximum 
Borrower exposure must also be considered. 
19.1 Postcode category 
Postcodes are classified by Firstmac as either Category 1a, 1b, 2 or 3 as per the Firstmac 
Acceptable Security Location list. The postcode categories are based on population figures 
obtained from recent census data, and the geographic spread of the postcode. 
Postcodes not listed are classified by Firstmac as ‘non-lend postcodes’ and will generally not be 
accepted.  
19.1.1 Postcode sub-category 
An additional sub-category may be applied to some postcodes, with restrictions on LVR, loan 
amount, or both.  
• ‘Mining’ 
o applies to some Category 3 postcodes that are ‘mining towns’ (local economy is 
predominantly reliant on mining industry) 
o Category 3 with sub-category ‘Mining’ restrictions: 
▪ Security use Owner Occupied – maximum LVR 70% and loan repayments 
must be P&I 
▪ Security use Investment – not acceptable security 
• ‘Do not lend’ 
o Added to postcodes where Firstmac will not accept security eg islands not 
connected to mainland Australia or Tasmania by road 
19.2 Maximum LVR & Loan Amounts by Postcode location 
Maximum LVRs and maximum loan amounts apply on a ‘per security’ basis and may vary by 
occupancy type (ie owner occupied or investment), loan purpose and security type. 
Regardless of the number of securities offered, the maximum loan size is $2,000,000.  
Where LMI is required, the relevant policy regarding maximum loan amount per security needs 
to be considered however, Firstmac limits above must also be met.

20 Repayment types 
Firstmac offers the following repayment options:  
Term loans 
• Principal & Interest amortising over the term of the loan 
• Blended Interest Only and Principal & Interest which 
allows for an initial interest only period of up to 5 years 
then amortising over the remaining loan term 
21 Loan term 
Principal & interest 
repayments 
Maximum loan term available is 30 years 
Interest only 
repayments  
Interest only period of 5 years maximum. Overall loan term 
of maximum 30 years.  
22 Interest rate options 
The interest rate options available are:  
• Variable  
• Fixed for terms of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 years (may vary from time to time) 
Fixed rates may not be available on all products – refer to individual product specifications.  
When a borrower applies for a fixed rate loan, the interest rate is not set until the day of 
settlement. The interest rate for that particular day will be applied to the borrower’s loan for 
the fixed term required. 
If a variable rate loan with an Offset sub-account is converted to a fixed rate loan, the Offset 
sub-account will no longer be available. 
22.1 Fixed rate break costs 
Fixed rate loans attract break costs where the loan is repaid either in full or in part and where 
the interest rate at which the repaid amount can be re-lent is less than the actual fixed interest 
rate of the loan at the time of repayment.  
23 Split loan options 
Except for Construction Loans, borrowers may create sub-accounts within the loan and receive 
separate statements for each sub-account. These sub-accounts must have the borrowers name 
in the title followed by an identifying name (or names) and may relate to:  
• Loan purpose – personal, investment, business, refinance, purchase  
• Loan type – variable rate, fixed rate, P&I, Interest Only  

 
53 
Firstmac Limited ABN 59 094 145 963 
AFSL/Australian Credit Licence 290600 
 
• Security type – owner occupied, investment, property 1, property 2  
• Product type – standard loan product, line of credit  
There is no fee charged where sub-accounts are established upon settlement of the loan.  
Where the borrower elects to establish sub-accounts after settlement of the loan, a fee will be 
payable except in those cases where the sub-account comes into being as a result of a portion 
of the loan being fixed. 
24 Repayments 
Repayments must be by way of a direct debit against a nominated account with a financial 
institution or on some products by electronic salary crediting (refer to individual product 
specifications). In all cases a signed direct debit authority against a nominated bank account is 
to be held, even though it is not active as is the case with salary crediting. Repayments are not 
to be made directly to an Originator / Mortgage Manager.  
Repayments may be made either weekly, fortnightly or monthly.  
Borrowers may make additional principal payments to their loan account at any time or pay a 
regular nominated amount in excess of their normal loan repayment. Break costs may be 
payable if principal reductions are made during a fixed rate period (refer to Fixed rate break 
costs section of this policy).  
If a borrower has elected to make the minimum repayment on their Firstmac loan and a rate 
rise occurs, Firstmac will automatically increase the loan repayment amount to cover the 
interest rate rise.  
Similarly, if a borrower has chosen to repay a fixed amount greater than the minimum 
repayment and a rate rise occurs, Firstmac will automatically increase the loan repayment to 
cover the minimum repayment amount in the event that the fixed amount originally set no 
longer covers the minimum repayment amount required.  
24.1 BSB details 
Borrowers are able to credit their account using a number of methods and will require the BSB 
and account number (x-reference, not application number) to facilitate the transfer.

25 Redraw 
A redraw of excess payments is available on most Firstmac variable rate loan products subject 
to the loan not being in default at the time of the request. The availability of the redraw facility 
is at the discretion of Firstmac.  
For most loans a redraw may be arranged by way telephone, Internet request (funds transfer 
and biller payment) or by contacting the Originator / Mortgage Manager by telephone or in 
writing (refer to individual product specifications). Where the loan account has transactional 
functionality, additional access to redraw funds is available by way of ATM and EFTPOS 
facilities.  
26 Variations and Substitutions 
26.1 Internal refinances, additional advances and further advances 
For any loan increases (top-ups) and further advances, a new application form and standard 
supporting documentation is required. The application will be assessed using all credit criteria 
current at the time of the request. 
Where an updated valuation is required, the Valuation firm that completed the original 
valuation should be used for the updated valuation. If the value of the security has increased 
within 12 months of the original valuation, the Valuer should comment on the reasons for the 
increased value eg further improvements completed since last valuation etc. 
If the original loan is mortgage insured, the mortgage insurer’s requirements will need to be 
followed. 
26.2 Other Variations  
All variations to existing loans such as substitution of security, partial discharge of security and 
consents (plan of subdivision, 2nd mortgage, lease etc), must be submitted to Firstmac for 
assessment and approval. 
27 Identifying borrowers  
Under the Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Act 2006 (Cth) (‘’AML/CTF Act’’), 
Firstmac must identify certain information collected about an individual’s identity before it 
provides them with services and products. Please refer to Firstmac’s requirements and 
procedures regarding collection and verification of this information. 
Firstmac's agreements with the Originator / Mortgage Manager Agents or Brokers appoint

amended from time to time, the Firstmac AML/CTF Program will prevail. 
28 Offset sub-account 
Where a loan product includes an Offset sub-account, all loan repayments and additional 
payments to the loan account can be credited to the Offset sub-account. The Offset sub-
account is 100% offset against the loan. 
Loan repayments are debited from the Offset sub-account and applied to the loan/s Redraws 
are debited from the Offset sub-account.  
Borrowers will receive separate account statements for the loan account and the separate 
Offset sub-account. 
29 Self-Certified (Lo Doc) loans 
Self-Certified (Lo Doc) loans are no longer available. Where a borrower with an existing Lo Doc 
loan requires additional borrowings, the loan must be converted to a Full Doc loan with all 
standard supporting documents and credit assessment for a Full Doc loan to apply.

AFSL/Australian Credit Licence 290600 
 
29.1 Self-Certified (Lo Doc) loan conversions 
Self-Certified (Lo Doc) borrowers who have obtained the last two (2) years taxation returns and 
financial statements are eligible to have their loan re-assessed to see if they qualify for a fully 
verified loan.  
If the borrower qualifies, Firstmac will require a new, fully completed loan application form and 
may require an updated valuation depending on the age of the current valuation held together 
with fully verified income documentation, tax returns ATO notices etc.  
All costs incurred in the changeover are borne by the borrower/s.  
30 Building insurance 
A Certificate of Currency of Insurance for the security property issued by the Insurer, is required 
for each security property prior to settlement. In all cases, the first mortgagee’s interest must 
be noted on the policy until the debt is repaid. 
Improvements (the building) are to be insured against damage and destruction for not less than 
its full replacement value. If the property is in a bushfire or flood prone area, or is subject to a 
specific environmental or other risk, the insurance policy should cover such risks.  
Cover notes or certificates issued by an insurance broker or body corporate are not accepted. It 
is the borrower’s responsibility to ensure the building insurance for full replacement value 
remains current, with the first mortgagee’s interest noted on the policy, until the debt is repaid.  
31 Self Managed Super Funds (SMSF) 
The legislative requirements applicable to loans to SMSFs includes a requirement that lenders 
have no right of recourse against the SMSF assets other than the security property, which also 
has to be held in a separate security custodian trust. 
The legal title and legal ownership to the property must be held on trust by an independent 
trustee (the “security custodian trustee") and the SMSF must have the ability to acquire the 
legal interest in the property. 
The SMSF must comply with all regulations applying to superannuation funds, Superannuation 
Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (the “’SIS Act’’) as amended. 
The basic structure of for an SMSF loan is: 
Trustee for Complying Self Managed Super Fund (SMSF)  
The SMSF is the borrower and beneficial owner of property. The SMSF Trustee(s) can be 
individual trustees where all members of the SMSF must be trustees; or a corporate 
trustee where all members of the SMSF must be directors of the trustee company.  
Security custodian trustee is the legal owner of property  
The security custodian / trustee must be a company, but must be a different company 
to the SMSF company trustee (if applicable). It does not matter who the 
directors/shareholders of the security custodian trustee are – they can be anyone. 

 
57 
Firstmac Limited ABN 59 094 145 963 
AFSL/Australian Credit Licence 290600 
 
Lender provides the loan 
Firstmac lends to the complying SMSF and has no recourse against the assets of the 
SMSF other than the security property.  
31.1 Borrower (SMSF) 
The ‘Borrower’ is the SMSF Trustee, which holds the beneficial interest in the security property.  
The SMSF trustee must have the right to acquire the property from the Property Trustee, and 
must be permitted to borrow in accordance with the relevant legislative requirements (and any 
associated regulations). 
Where the trustees of the SMSF are individuals, the loan will be made to the Trustees in their 
own right and as Trustee for the SMSF. 
Trust deeds and documentation will be reviewed by Firstmac Legal Counsel, or nominated 
panel lawyers, to confirm satisfactory to Firstmac and need to include provision for: 
• Borrowed funds being applied for the acquisition of the purchased property, 
• Purchased property is being held on trust for the SMSF so the SMSF acquires a beneficial 
interest, 
• When the mortgage is paid out in full, title to the property may be transferred to the 
SMSF or Security Custodian Trustee can continue as registered proprietor. 
• Name, address and ACN (if a company) of SMSF Trustee. 
31.2 Personal guarantee from Members (SMSF) 
Personal guarantees from all adult beneficiaries (members) of the SMSF for the full loan 
amount are required. 
Where the trustees of the SMSF are individuals, the trustee is a borrower in their own right & as 
trustee for the SMSF so additional personal guarantees from the trustees are not required. 
However, personal guarantees from all members that are not also trustees, are required. 
31.3 Independent Legal Advice (SMSF)  
SMSF borrowers and guarantors are to obtain independent legal advice. Evidence the advice 
has been obtained must be provided prior to settlement. 
For refinances where the SMSF and guarantors can provide evidence that independent legal 
advice has been obtained previously for the loan being refinanced, the advice for the new 
refinance loan will be waived. 
31.4 Credit Report & Credit History (SMSF) 
A credit report through Equifax is required for each individual associated with the loan including 
guarantors and directors of any corporate trustee. Credit reports are to be completed and 
reviewed per section Credit Reports. 
All parties associated with the SMSF loan must have clear credit, with no history of defaults, 
judgement or bankruptcy.

31.10 Serviceability (SMSF) 
Serviceability is to be calculated using the Firstmac SMSF Servicing Calculator with minimum 
NDI 1.00:1 required. 
SMSFs must be able to service the loan from existing SMSF income and assets, proposed rental 
income and members’ contributions. 
The serviceability assessment will include a review of: 
• The stability & history of super fund contributions & other fund income. 
• The capacity to continue making the required superannuation fund contributions and 
consideration given to the timing of super fund contributions (which may be ‘lumpy’ or 
irregular). 
• Where the member / contributor is self-employed, an appropriate assessment of the 
underlying trading business or other sources that will be relied upon to make ongoing 
contributions. 
31.10.1 
Serviceability assessment rate (SMSF) 
Firstmac’s SMSF Serviceability Assessment Rate is used to calculate stressed repayments for 
new and ongoing mortgage loans.  
• New lending: 
o Loans that have a variable interest rate, or a fixed rate term < 5 years – the 
higher of (1) the actual rate of the loan plus an assessment rate buffer of 2.00% 
pa; or (2) the assessment rate floor of 6.25% pa. 
o Loans that have a fixed rate term of 5 years – the actual rate is used as the 
assessment rate with no buffer or floor rate applied. 
• Existing settled / ongoing investment loans: 
o Firstmac funded loans – the higher of (1) actual loan rate + buffer of 2.00% pa; or 
(2) the assessment rate floor of 6.25% pa. 
o Other financial institution (OFI) loans – assessment rate 9.25% pa. 
31.10.2 
Acceptable income for serviceability (SMSF) 
Acceptable sources of income to demonstrate serviceability by the SMSF: 
• 100% of mandatory superannuation contributions (SGC as determined by ASIC). 
• 100% of non-mandatory / voluntary contributions may be considered to support 
serviceability of the SMSF, provided the additional contributions are regular and 
evidenced. 
o Where not regular, or the amount of additional contributions needs to be 
increased for serviceability of the SMSF, each member of the SMSF must 
demonstrate their own ability to provide the required additional contributions – 
refer to SMSF Members serviceability section of this policy.  

 
61 
Firstmac Limited ABN 59 094 145 963 
AFSL/Australian Credit Licence 290600 
 
• Rental income – if multiple sources of evidence are provided, higher actual rent received 
may be used if the property is rented through a real estate agent with a copy of a 
current tenancy agreement or rental statements provided. Otherwise, the lowest rental 
amount should be used. Rental income relied on for serviceability as follows: 
o 80% of rental income from residential investment properties held by SMSF, 
including proposed rental income where the loan is for a purchase. 
o 70% of existing rental income from commercial investment properties held by 
the SMSF. 
• Income from interest / dividend earnings in the SMSF based on a deemed return of 
return equal to the RBA cash rate. Where actual investment income is evidenced to be 
consistently higher in the last 2 years SMSF tax returns, up to 80% of the lower year may 
be relied on. Current evidence of the investments must be provided (eg super fund 
statements, current shareholding, term deposits etc).  
• Negative gearing benefits can be included in calculations (auto calculated in the 
Firstmac SMSF Serviceability Calculator). 
• Projected income from future investments, and income from non-SMSF assets is not 
permitted. 
31.10.3 
Expenses (SMSF) 
Ongoing expenses associated with running the SMSF are taken in to consideration by ensuring 
the Minimum liquid asset position (SMSF) is met.  
31.10.4 
Member’s serviceability assessment (SMSF) 
Where there is a history of non-compulsory contributions that are sufficient to support the 
SMSF’s serviceability assessment (if applicable), a serviceability assessment of the SMSF 
members as individuals is not required. 
If, however, new or increased non-compulsory contributions to the SMSF are needed to 
support the SMSF’s serviceability assessment, each individual SMSF member’s financial position 
should be assessed. 
Details of each Member’s individual financial position should be collected, including living 
expenses, a full statement of assets & liabilities, and evidence of all personal income (refer 
Acceptable income types). 
The serviceability assessment for the individual members is to determine they have sufficient 
surplus net disposable income after all personal expenses / commitments & liabilities, to make 
the additional contributions required for the SMSF to service the loan. 
31.11 Security for SMSF loans 
In addition to the requirements shown in Security section, SMSF loans must only be secured by 
a “single asset” comprising a security single dwelling property on a single title (not two or more 
separate titles).

32 Bridging loans 
Bridging loans provide a finance option for borrowers requiring a short term increased level of 
debt to assist with the purchase of a new property before completing the sale of an existing 
property. 
Once the existing property is sold, total debt may be repaid in full (e.g. downsizing), or reduced 
with sale proceeds leaving an ‘end debt’ that is repaid over the remaining term of the loan. 
Definitions:  
Initial amount financed – the total funding required to complete the new purchase, refinance 
any existing debt on the existing property being sold, any fees associated with the purchase 
(e.g. stamp duty), and any fees associated with the establishment of the bridging loan fee that 
are capitalised to the loan. 
Peak debt – the initial amount financed (including the upfront bridging loan fee) and interest 
charges capitalised during the bridge period.  
End debt – the residual loan amount required after the existing property has sold.  
Bridge period or term – the period from the initial settlement until the sale of the existing 
property settles and the debt is paid out in full, or reduced to the end debt amount.  
32.1 Bridging loan criteria 
Summary of the parameters that apply during the bridge period: 
• Minimum Equifax CCR score 700 for the Primary Borrower (ie borrower with highest 
income) 
• New property being purchased must be owner occupied; existing property being sold 
can be owner occupied or investment 
• Maximum LVR 80% based on the peak debt 

 
66 
Firstmac Limited ABN 59 094 145 963 
AFSL/Australian Credit Licence 290600 
 
• Maximum LVR 80% based on end debt, assuming 20% haircut on original property to be 
sold 
• Maximum bridging loan peak debt $3.0M, reducing to standard limits post sale of the 
existing property, refer Loan Amount   
• Category 1a and 1b postcodes only – refer Postcode Category 
• Existing property must be listed for sale prior to settlement of the new purchase 
• All other applicable credit criteria applies 
32.2 Bridging loan structure 
At the commencement of the loan, a mortgage is taken over the new property being 
purchased, and the existing property that is to be sold.  
Where there is an existing debt on the property to be sold, that debt needs to be refinanced to 
Firstmac and must settle simultaneously with the new purchase settlement.  
When the sale of the existing property settles, the bridge period ends. The loan will either be 
repaid in full (i.e. no end debt), or where an end debt applies, the loan reverts to a standard 
home loan for the remainder of the total loan term selected. 
32.2.1 Loan term – bridge period & end debt 
The bridge period / term must be selected at the commencement of the bridging loan.  
Where an end debt will apply, the overall loan term can be up to 30 years (subject to Age of 
borrower / guarantor requirements) however the bridge period selected must be either 6 or 12 
months. Where no end debt will apply, the loan term matches the bridge period selected ie 6 or 
12 months.  
32.2.2 Interest rate type during bridge period 
The interest rate applied during the bridge period is fixed. After the bridge period, the interest 
rate reverts to a standard loan product with a variable interest rate.   
32.2.3 Interest charges & repayments during bridge period 
The initial 3 months of the bridge period are interest free with an upfront fee payable that is 
capitalised to the loan. If the bridge period ends within the initial 3 months, the upfront fee is 
not refundable. 
After the initial 3 months, interest is calculated on daily balances and charged to the loan 
monthly on the anniversary of the settlement date. The interest charged to the loan for months 
4 – 6 inclusive is capitalised to the loan, resulting in the peak debt at the end of the 6th month.  
As the upfront fee and interest charged during month 4 – 6 inclusive is capitalised, monthly 
repayments are not required to be made during the initial 6 months of the bridge period.  
For loans with a 12 month bridge period, interest is calculated on the peak debt from month 7 – 
12 inclusive, with monthly interest only repayments required during that period.

32.3 Serviceability – bridging loans 
Serviceability for the bridge period is assessed up front on the calculated peak debt (refer 
Serviceability during the bridge period), and on the end debt i.e. the loan amount after existing 
property is sold. The Firstmac Bridging Loan serviceability calculator must be used for bridging 
loans.  
The serviceability test for bridging loans can include all standard Acceptable income types, and 
must take into consideration the borrower’s living expenses and ongoing commitments as per 
Loan serviceability calculation.  
32.3.1 Serviceability during the bridge period 
For loans with a bridge period of 6 months, there is no bridge period serviceability assessment 
required as any interest charged during the bridge period is capitalised to the loan. 
Loans with a bridge period of 12 months however will require a serviceability assessment to 
ensure sufficient net disposable income to cover the interest only repayments on the peak debt 
for month 7 – 12 inclusive.  
Due to the nature of bridging loans, the interest only repayments for this serviceability 
assessment are calculated using the peak debt amount at the bridging loan interest rate (fixed 
for bridge period); the residual PI loan term is not used for the calculation of the bridging loan 
repayment.  
32.3.2 Serviceability of the end debt 
Where there will be an end debt after the existing property is sold, the standard serviceability 
assessment (refer Loan serviceability calculation) is required using the residual PI loan term e.g. 
loan written over 30 years including 12 month bridge term – serviceability of the end debt will 
be assessed over 29 years. 
32.4 Valuations for bridging loans 
Standard valuation policy applies to bridging loans – refer Security Valuations. 
A valuation is to be completed on both properties taken as security at the time of origination, at 
which time the LVR is assessed for both the peak debt, and the end debt (using the security to 
be retained only). No further valuation of the property being retained as security for the end 
debt is required at the end of the bridge period to facilitate the discharge of the property that 
has been sold.

Valuation Variation Notice 
 
We wish to advise that a property valuation report has been completed for the above address by an 
independent certified valuer.  
 
The valuation report is for mortgage purposes only and takes into account a range of risks, including 
recent market movements and environmental factors. The report includes an estimated amount for which 
the property would be expected to exchange between a buyer and a seller.  
 
This notice is issued for the purposes of informing you that the property valuation report indicates the 
purchase price is <<insert % variance>> above the current market value assessed by the valuer.  
 
You cannot rely on a lender’s valuation report for your own purposes and it is recommended you make 
your own enquiries as to the value of the property. 
 
Despite the reduced valuation, the Lender is prepared to proceed with your loan application, should you 
wish to continue.  
 
If you want to proceed with your loan application, please confirm and acknowledge this valuation variation 
advice by signing below.  
 
If you would like to discuss the matter further please do not hesitate to contact us.  
 
Yours sincerely

Firstmac is prepared to accept residential property valuations for lending purposes and is 
intended to outline Firstmac’s expectations with regard to instructions for the preparation of

and interpreted in conjunction with the Valuation Standards.  
 
Firstmac reserves the right to not accept a residential property valuation submitted to Firstmac which 
does not meet the Valuation Standards. 
 
To the extent that a particular section of the Valuation Standards cannot be complied with, such non-
compliance must be raised with Firstmac and prior approval sought for an alternative means of 
complying with the relevant section.  
 
Specific Firstmac DLA Discretion - Firstmac Credit may approve exceptions to non-compliance with 
particular sections of the Valuation Standards on a case by case basis depending on the relevant

10. A comprehensive list and detailed information on the most recent comparable sales should be

value. Relevant comparable sales older than 3 months may be used in this assessment however 
a detailed explanation on the adjustment made to account for present market conditions must 
be provided. 
 
Comments Required in Valuations 
• 
Include any negative or positive features which may impact on marketability or early sale of the 
property (i.e. termite damage, specialised use, easements and incomplete renovations). Please
