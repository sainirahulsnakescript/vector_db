from family or friends that must be repaid)
current and post liabilities and debt repayments, including any repayable non-genuine savings (ie: loan funded deposit from
family/friends)
whether the customer has experienced any previous form of financial hardship (not limited to dealings with NAB), within the past
two years (including where they are still on a repayment pause); and; whether the customer expects there will be a change in their
future financial circumstances, such as
Extended unpaid leave (e.g. parental leave)
Reduced income
End of contract (loss of employment/redundancy)
Increased debt repayments for an existing loan
Large expenditure
Medical treatment/illness
Impacts of a pandemic or natural disaster e.g.

2.1 Responsible Lending Obligations
Your responsible lending obligations require you to make reasonable enquiries about the customer(s) objectives, financial situation and
requirements including taking reasonable steps to verify their information. You must make an assessment that a particular loan with a particular
credit provider is not unsuitable for the client.
The National Consumer Credit Protection (NCCP) including National Credit Code (NCC) regulates the form and content of consumer credit
documents and the conduct of consumer credit providers. It applies where the purpose is:
For personal, domestic or household uses or
To purchase, renovate or improve a residential investment property; or
To refinance credit that was originally for either of the above two purposes.
Where the loan is NCCP regulated you must not provide credit assistance if the consumer could not meet their obligations or could do so only
with substantial hardship.

It is your responsibility, under the responsible lending obligations of NCCP, to verify the financial situation of the applicant. You must also
establish whether the applicant can meet their obligations without substantial hardship.

2.2 Co-Borrower Benefit
Brokers must ensure all co-borrowers on a loan facility receive a “Substantial Benefit” from the loan proceeds and helps to protect vulnerable
members of our society from financial abuse. 
Substantial Benefit
An Individual can only be accepted as a co-borrower where it can be evidenced that they receive a ‘Substantial Benefit’ from the loan proceeds. 
For new home loans and increases involving joint applicants, brokers must identify whether each individual co-borrower will receive a
substantial benefit.    
This is not required for company borrowers or individual borrowers who are:
acting in their capacity as trustee;
directors of co-borrower companies;
partners in a partnership;
in a joint venture arrangement.
A ‘Substantial Benefit’ includes where: 
Each co-borrower acquires a reasonably proportionate legal or equitable interest in assets purchased with the loan funds; or 
Each co-borrower utilises a reasonable portion of the loans funds to repay their debts or other obligations owed by the co-
borrower; or 
Each co-borrower will utilise and have access to a reasonable portion of the loan funds which is not covered above (for example, a
holiday, medical expenses, household goods etc).
The minimum percentage required to achieve ‘Substantial Benefit’ is set out below:
Number of Individual Co-Borrowers 
Minimum amount deemed ‘Substantial Benefit’
2 to 4 
Minimum 25%
5 or more
Equal share
Structuring Options
In cases where a Substantial Benefit cannot be demonstrated, Brokers must discuss with the proposed co-borrower:
why they want to be a co-borrower; and
alternative structuring options such as providing a security guarantee, or subject to meeting credit policy requirements, becoming
a servicing guarantor.
The customer needs to understand the risks associated with entering into the loan, and understand the difference between being a co-borrower
and a guarantor. You must recommend the customer obtain independent legal and financial advice before we accept an individual without
Substantial Benefit as a co-borrower.
Co-Borrower Liability 
Guarantor liability 
A co-borrower may have to repay the entire amount owing
alone.
The bank does not have to ask any other co-borrower to
repay before it asks any other co-borrower, or at the same
time the bank asks any other co-borrower;
This is because each co-borrower is each individually and
directly responsible for the loan repayment obligations. If
there’s a problem with repayment of the loan, the bank may
pursue all co-borrowers or any one of them individually for
the amount owing.
A Guarantor is someone who promises to repay money that is owed to us
under a loan, if for some reason the borrower doesn’t. If the individual were a
guarantor instead of a borrower, the bank may be required to take steps
against the borrower before it can enforce mortgages given by the guarantor
or judgements against the guarantor.
A guarantor may be able to limit their liability in accordance with the
Banking Code of Practice and legislation. A guarantor may also be able to ask
for contribution from the borrower/s and from other guarantors. The
Banking Code of Practice and the law generally provide other protections to
guarantors that will not apply to a borrower.

Accepting Co-Borrowers without Substantial Benefit
NAB Broker, excluding Commercial Broker, has no appetite for new lending for Co-Borrowers who are not in a spousal/de-facto relationship,
where any Co-Borrower will not receive a Substantial Benefit.
NAB Broker has limited appetite for amendments and variations to existing lending for Co-Borrowers who are not in a spousal/de-facto
relationship, where any Co-Borrower will not receive a Substantial Benefit. A minimum DCA Level 3 approval is required for these applications.
Where an Individual Co-Borrower does not receive a ‘Substantial Benefit’ from the loan requested, and does not wish to be a Guarantor, you may
accept them as a co-borrower using the exception process provided the following requirements are met. 
The Broker:
has provided to each co-borrower not receiving as substantial benefit the Co-borrower Information Sheet and Guarantor
Information Sheet.
has considered and documented the reasons why that individual wants to be a Co-Borrower, and the rationale supplied does not
raise concerns;
is satisfied that the Individual Co-Borrower without a Substantial Benefit is not experiencing financial abuse by completing the
financial abuse check list and has not identified any other signs of financial abuse; 
has recommended the Co-Borrower obtain independent legal and financial advice in order to understand the risks associated with
entering into the loan and the difference between being a Co-Borrower and a Guarantor; and
Having given the proposed co-borrower an opportunity to consider their options and the co-borrower has indicated they want to
proceed as a co-borrower, ensures the Co-Borrower has reviewed and duly executed the ‘Personal Consent form’ prior to
submission.
Back to top ^
2.3 Additional Broker Responsibilities
Brokers must:
personally interview each borrower and guarantor
conduct face to face interviews with each borrower and guarantor for all applications
Obtain the Customer’s Consent for all entities prior to the loan assessment.
Exceptions to this policy must:
be held in writing from NAB
be obtained via your Business Development Manager (BDM); and
submitted with your application for credit.
For guidance on what needs to be addressed in your request, refer to Broker Checklist (PDF, 160KB)

2.4 Aggregate Lending Exposures
Aggregated Exposure is where two or more individual or entities are linked by any of the following criteria:
Securities and/or guarantees
Common ownership or management
Ability to control, directly or indirectly
Financial interdependency
Other connections or relationships that NAB's Delegated Commitment Authority (DCA) holder considers a single risk.

overseas citizens who do not hold an Australian Permanent Residency visa
overseas citizen who do not hold an eligible Temporary Resident Visa (refer below for ineligible visa list)
eligible Temporary Resident Visa Holders residing overseas

This includes borrowers, guarantors and joint applications. For example, where a Permanent Resident (as the sole income earner) and an
overseas citizen living overseas (with no income) are on the same application, the application is ineligible as one of the applicants is an excluded
borrower.

For joint applications where there is more than one visa type, the most conservative position is to be taken. This is to be the case even where no
income is taken into consideration for one of the applicants. For example, where an Australian citizen (as the majority income earner) and an
eligible Temporary Visa holder residing in Australia (as the minority income holder) are on the same application, product restrictions applicable
to the eligible Temporary Visa holder must apply including maximum LVR 70%.
4.2.3 Foreign (Overseas) currency income treatment
Foreign income restrictions apply to both borrowers and guarantors.

any foreign currency income earned by a borrower or guarantor who is Self Employed, a Company or a Trust.
Note: Self employed is a sole trader or ‘proprietor’, traders as part of a business partnership or a company director where they own or control the
business.
Multiple Temporary Working and Skilled Visa Resident types (e.g: Visa Subclass 188) are issued on the basis that the applicant has demonstrated
an ownership interest in an established business (overseas) and intends to establish, develop and manage a new or existing business within
Australia and would typically meet Self Employed customer requirements.
4.2.4 Product restrictions
LVR must not exceed 70% (except where they are Australian Citizens, NZ Citizens and Australian Permanent Residency Visa holders
where LVR must not exceed 80%).
No Building in the Course of Erection (BICOE) Loans available.

Foreign Applicants are not permitted to obtain ‘Cash Out’.
Cross-collateralisation of an existing security to 70% LVR (or 80% LVR where allowed) to support a new contracted property
purchase is permitted.
Foreign Applicants are not permitted to provide security in Group A Security Postcodes - Refer 7.6.1 Reduced LVR Post Codes

Note:
Should an unsigned copy of building contract or tender be provided, the Valuer may at their discretion, request for a copy of a
fully signed building contract before conducting the Construction Valuation.
If valuation is conducted with unsigned building contract or tender, it is mandatory a signed copy is obtained and information
reconciled with initial details, and should there be any variations, then a new valuation will be required.
Additional Quotes ("out of contract") Items
"Out of contract" items are additional items which may be included in the Construction Loan which are not included in the main building
contract, for example: in-ground pool, landscaping, shed, etc.
If "out of contract" items are to be included in the Construction Valuation:
only formal quotations/tenders/contracts from third party contractors (i.e. Not the owner) will be taken into consideration
"out of contract" items will only be included if they pertain to fit-out and/or ancillary improvements.
Progress Inspections and valuation during construction
An inspection and valuation is required when the:
slab or base claim is requested or the first claim is requested after the base stage is completed
and
final progress payment is requested. (NB: An additional final progress inspection may be required once 'out of contract' items
have been completed, e.g: pool, shed).

5.4 Security value
The security's market value is calculated using the lower of the following values:
cost of construction plus the land value
valuer’s estimated End Market Value (EMV). 
Brokers must enter the following details in the 'security details' view:
total cost of building upon completion
building completion date.

5.7 Construction/progressive payment stages
BICOE Loans are progressively drawn down:
at each stage of building construction, as per builders contract
within a maximum term of 24 months of the first loan drawdown.
An inspection and valuation of work completed at various stages of construction may be required. A fee is payable for each inspection carried
out.
At the completion of each stage:
the builder/ service provider will present your client with an invoice
the client’s contribution is to be used up front before the finance is drawn
we may require an inspection and valuation of work completed.
to process the drawdown we need to be provided with the invoice, signed by all applicants.
For the final Progressive Payment to be made, the following documents are required:
a copy of the occupancy certificate for new homes (or as per state requirements)
a copy of the final inspection certificate for renovations and extensions
a copy of the building insurance/fire policy.
Back to top ^
5.8 Cost overruns
BICOE payments can only be made up to the progressive valuation amount for each stage of construction. If the loan balance plus BICOE claim is
higher than the progressive valuation, this is considered a cost overrun.
Customers are responsible for paying any cost overruns associated with the construction from their own resources. Progressive payments will be
stopped immediately until any cost overrun has been met.
If the customer cannot meet this overrun, referral to within NAB Broker is to occur to determine how the application can be progressed to ensure
the security is completed.

6.6 When is Independent Legal Advice required
CARE: effective 25 May 2020 for new NAB Broker (excluding Commercial Broker) lending
applications, individual guarantors providing guarantees to individual borrowers must be
in a spousal or de-facto relationship with the borrower.
Applications for variations and amendments of an existing guaranteed loan will continue to
be accepted.
Home Loan applications requiring guarantees for all other purposes can continue to be processed by Retail, Direct and Broker channels. This
includes guarantees from companies and trustees.
Customers’ obligations are different between being a guarantor and being a co-borrower (further details can be found on UYC001 –
Understanding Your Customer 
 ). Bankers must not suggest a customer who wants to be a guarantor to be a co-borrower.
Brokers must explain that:
- where there is more than one customer involved with a loan, NAB only accepts co-borrowers where they have substantial benefit from
the loan unless they are spouses or defactos;
- for spouses and defactos without substantial benefit, the co-borrower eligibility requirements must be met.
If the customers want a guarantee relationship or don’t meet our eligibility requirements to be co-borrowers, brokers should ask these
customers to use an alternative provider.
6.1 About Guarantees to Bank
A Guarantee to Bank may be a stand-alone guarantee or a combined Guarantee and indemnity, depending on the loan purpose. 
The terms 'Guarantee' and 'Indemnity' are defined as follows: 
Term
Definition
Guarantee
A Guarantee is a legally binding promise (to NAB) by one person (or other legal entity), called the
guarantor or the surety, to pay the present or future debt of another party, called the customer, borrower
or the principal debtor. That borrower however must be legally bound to pay the debt before a guarantor
will also be liable.
Indemnity
An Indemnity is a legally binding promise (to the Bank) by one person (or other legal entity), called the
indemnifier, to pay a debt or perform some other act when another party (the customer, borrower or
principal debtor) fails to do it, whether or not that borrower is legally bound to do it (because, for
example, the loan contract is unenforceable against the borrower).
 
A Guarantee can either be:
Term
Definition
"Supported"
A specifically identified additional security provided by the guarantor, secures their liability under the
Guarantee.

“Supported by General
Position”
No additional security by the Guarantor is specifically identified at the time the Guarantee is taken. The
guarantor's General Position is relied on to secure the Guarantee, which may include later provided
additional securities.
Back to top ^
6.2 When to take a Guarantee to Bank
A Guarantee to Bank is taken:
when a security provider is not a borrower;
an individual guarantor will be contributing towards the servicing of a debt, but is not also a borrower
(Note: A Guarantee is not required from a company/trust where the assessment includes self-employed income derived from that entity, unless
that entity is also a security provider); or
from the director/s of a company to support borrowing by the company.
(Note: Unless required to link for security or for debt servicing, a new or increased Guarantee is not required from the director/s of a company,
where the total aggregated home lending is $3,000,000 or less; and LVR is 80% or less) 
Back to top ^
6.3 Who can provide a Guarantee
Guarantors can be:
Individuals, who must be 18 years or older (no exceptions to this requirement are allowed); or
Companies.
Individuals and companies acting as trustees, provided the trust has the appropriate power to give a guarantee. (Note: When
assessing the suitability of trust guarantors, the Trust Deed must be provided to be reviewed).
Back to top ^
6.4 Types of Guarantors and Guarantor Assessment for Suitability
A Guarantee must only be accepted from a guarantor who is assessed as being suitable. A Guarantor Assessment for Suitability must be
completed for all guarantors and requirements differ according to guarantor types (refer to below table).
When assessing the suitability of a guarantor, brokers must:
ask the guarantor why they are agreeing to provide the Guarantee; and,
be able to show that the guarantor’s decision to provide the Guarantee was freely made, fully informed and had a reasonable
basis.
Do not proceed with taking a Guarantee in the following situations: 
where there are any signs to indicate that the Guarantee is not being provided on a voluntary basis, including (but not limited to)
signs of undue influence, coercion, duress or inappropriate pressure from the borrower, co-guarantors or third parties; 
where the individual guarantor reveals in any way that they do not understand the nature and effect of their obligations under the
Guarantee and the financial risks associated with providing the Guarantee;
where there is evidence of cognitive impairment;
where the individual guarantor, for any reason, is unable to read the documents for themselves in their original printed form or
does not appear to understand the documents; or,
where there are reputational, ethical or other reasons that would prevent NAB from enforcing the Guarantee or supporting
security at some future date.

https://www.nabbroker.com.au/secure/credit-policies/guarantees
2/6

Individuals (natural persons)
including:
Individuals acting as
trustee for a trust; or
Director guarantors 
When assessing the suitability for individual guarantors (including individuals acting as trustee for a
trust), brokers must:
Complete the appropriate Guarantee Assessment for Suitability form to determine whether
the guarantor is suitable.
Companies
When assessing the suitability for company guarantors, brokers must:
Identify that the company guarantor will receive sufficient benefit for its involvement in the
transaction.
In the event that a company guarantor does not receive sufficient benefit, the company shareholders or
parent company (if there is only one shareholder) must authorise the Guarantee & Indemnity being
given. 
Trusts
When assessing the suitability of trust guarantors, brokers must provide the trust deed for review.
Note: Where the trustee is an Individual, brokers must also refer to the Guarantor Suitability Assessment
Requirements for Individuals (natural persons).
For Commercial Broker Home Loan applications only:
Where a broker is submitting their own home lending application for finance, (i.e., where the broker is the borrower and/or guarantor in the
transaction), they cannot complete the Guarantor Assessment for Suitability on their own behalf, or for any party related to the transaction. In
this scenario, the business banker is required to complete the Guarantor Assessment for Suitability requirements for each guarantor.
Back to top ^
6.5 Assessing a Guarantor
Guarantors must complete the Guarantor particulars on the mortgage application form.
The broker is to collect financial statements from company guarantors.
NAB Broker will assess the following information:
Guarantor type
Guarantor Financial Assessment Requirement
Individual Guarantors
Assess the guarantor's:
employment and residential history;
surplus income and balance of assets and liabilities; and
capacity to pay the amount of their obligation in the event of a call under the
Guarantee, which may include their capacity to service a loan for the amount of the
guarantee.
Company Guarantors
Assess the:
Guarantor’s management capability and financial strength.
Corporate / commercial benefit to the company in signing the Guarantee, in regards
to:
its business;
its relationship with the customer; and
the likely impact of a demand under the Guarantee.
The guarantor’s income is being
relied upon for debt servicing
(Servicing Guarantor). 
In addition to the financial assessment requirements outlined above, the guarantor must
demonstrate capacity to service 100% of the amount of the guaranteed debt.
(Note: Where the servicing guarantor is the spouse/de-facto of the borrower; or a director of a
company borrower, brokers can assess the guarantor's ability to service the full loan amount
based on a joint financial position with the borrower)

Overview
Lender’s Mortgage Insurance (LMI) is integral to managing the additional risk associated with higher Loan to Valuation Ratio (LVR) lending.
It must be taken to insure facilities secured by a registered mortgage over residential property, where the LVR exceeds the percentage of
80% (or 70% for inner city investors) and facilities are provided:
for consumer purposes
for personal investment purposes
to individuals
to companies as trustee for a trust​
​
NAB Broker originated home loans are insured by QBE. LMI provided by Genworth prior to November 2020 is still retained on existing home
loans.
NAB has a Delegated Underwriting Authority (DUA) agreement with QBE, and therefore LMI is automatically approved by QBE when:
The home loan amount does not exceed $2.5 million;
Total aggregated lending does not exceed $2.5 million;
LVR is less than or equal to 95%;
LMI has not previously been waived on the existing loan;
Loan(s) have not previously been declined LMI by any LMI provider;
Customer does not have a poor credit history (for example loan is being re-structured to assist customer in making required
payments), and if;
For refinances and further advances (i.e. limit increases), facilities have not been irregular for 31 days or more at the time of
loan approval
When any of the above criteria are not met, lending is to be referred to QBE for manual assessment and approval. If QBE approval is
required, QBE specific lending criteria must be satisfied.

there is reason to believe the property value has deteriorated or there are authenticity doubts
the property has been impacted by a natural disaster
the security is an inner city apartment which requires the valuation to be no older than 90 days at loan drawdown date.

Once logged in, click on the 'Tools' tab if you are not automatically directed to the Premium Calculator.
To ensure you are using the most recent version of the LMI Premium Calculator, clear your browser cache before navigating to the
calculator.
How it works
The calculator will apply different premium rates, depending on the details of the scenario entered. The variables include:
Loan Amount
Value of Security
Loan type, i.e. investor or occupier
State to apply the correct stamp duty
NAB also applies a Reduced Input Tax Credit (RITC) discount to all LMI premiums. This discount is then automatically included in
calculations.
Top up loans
When calculating the premium for top up loans you should remember:
If there is an existing Genworth LMI policy, it will remain when a home loan is increased and a QBE LMI top up policy will be
created for the increased loan amount.
For a limit increase / top up where there is an existing Genworth or QBE LMI policy or estimate of the total premiums paid by
the customer, use the amount from the previous file in the 'Prem+GST Paid to Date' field in the calculator.  When the
application is processed the exact premiums paid will be confirmed by the Credit Assessor with the insurer directly.
Manual LMI premium estimates
In the following scenarios, the QBE LMI Premium Calculator is not able to be used. Please download the QBE Request Manual LMI Premium
Estimate template (DOCX, 14KB)

Home loans secured with family guarantees or term deposits that are considered complex applications.
Once completed the QBE support team will email you the estimated LMI premium.

Different scenarios to assist with LMI calculations
The following scenarios are here to assist Brokers in correctly calculating the LMI premium.  
First Home Buyers:
If a borrower is a first home buyer, they are eligible for the first home buyer premium discount, even if the borrower is not receiving the First
Home Owners Grant (FHOG). Ensure the following is selected correctly in the premium calculator in all cases (includes both Land and
Construction loans):
FHOG Eligible tick box is selected.
‘Loan Type’ is selected as Owner Occupied (FHOG discount is not applicable for Investment Purpose).
Loan amount does not exceed $2,500,000 (standard premium applies above this threshold).
For a top up construction loan on uninsured land, treat the total lending as a new loan in the premium calculator (do not
select ‘Additional loan’).
For a Construction loan increase on existing insured land, please contact your BDM for a manual premium quote.
Use whole numbers only.

Select the correct Loan Type, as this will impact the premium.  Note: This is based on the additional increase loan only and
the existing debt purpose should not be included.
The Calculator defaults the Loan Type to ‘Owner Occupied’.  For Investment purpose, ensure this is changed to reflect
the correct premium.
Enter in ‘premium paid to date’ figure (this is the previous premium amount plus GST only, not the amount the applicant has
previously paid).
For Genworth premium credits, use whole numbers only – remove the cents.
Enter current loan balance figure.  Note: This needs to be the current Loan Limit, not balance.  Use whole numbers only.
Ensure the correct security state is selected, as this may impact the premium due to individual state stamp duty.

10.2.2 How to treat Allowances
Some reoccurring Employee Allowances which are received regularly and are not temporary or seasonal can be included as PAYG income, as
long as they can be validated and evidenced in two consecutive payslips.
Employee Allowances may include (but not be limited to):
shift
uniform
laundry
height
meal
site
grooming
Note: Where Allowance amount is inconsistent and the variance is less than or equal to 20%, use the lower of the allowance value.
The income must be treated as Overtime where Employee Allowance/s either:
can’t be determined as recurring but are included in Year To Date (YTD) pay slip balances
have a greater than 20% variance between either payslip or YTD income values.
Note: When including the allowance as income, care needs to be taken that the corresponding expense is allowed for, in the customer’s expense
e.g. Grooming, travel allowance etc.
10.2.3 How to treat Deductions including Salary Sacrifice/HECS Debt
Employer Deductions including salary sacrifice do not require further enquiry where net income after deductions is used and debt servicing
remains evident.
HECS-HELP Debts
HECS-HELP debts are repaid via the ATO taxation system. When a customer earns above the minimum income threshold their required
repayment percentage will be deducted by their employer as an additional taxation amount.
When recording a ‘HECS’ liability enter the customer declared limit/balance outstanding and the attributed taxation percentage should be
recorded as a liability repayment.
Employee Deduction can be added back to gross income where either:
the deduction can be evidenced as a repayment being declared in the application (e.g: car lease or home loan repayments)
expenses actually incurred are reflected in the customers declared general living expenses (i.e: Meals card, parking)
the deduction can be verified as being cancelled.
Employee deductions removed from income used in debt servicing do not require further inquiry to be made where servicing remains evident.
To add back deductions, including salary sacrifice, to the customers base wage brokers must:
Verify the type of deduction, and document that there is clear rationale as to why it is an acceptable deduction to add back; and
Tax will apply in accordance with the below table:
Deductions Added Back
Add back the deduction amount to the customers gross income; and.
Tax the total gross income in accordance with customers individual
tax rate.
Fringe Benefit Exempt Employees (amounts up to
$970 per month) per eligible FBT exempt
employer
Add back deduction/s as tax free where the customer is eligible for a
Fringe Benefit Exemption.
Public Benevolent Society and Health Promotion
Charities (amounts up to $1545 per month) per
eligible FBT exempt employer
Confirm the charity is registered as a public benevolent society on the
Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC).
Add back deduction/s as tax free.
Fringe Benefit Exempt Employees, Public
Benevolent Society, Health Promotion Charities
Exceeding the amounts stated in this table as tax free is acceptable
where confirmation is held in writing from the employer that they pay
the tax on the employee's behalf.
In all other cases, the excess amounts should have the customers
effective tax rate applied.

need to be included in the liability repayment amount
Post tax deductions – Must be included in the liability repayment
amount but do not need to be included as a deduction.

10.12.1 Government Allowances
The Australian Government regularly makes changes to eligibility criteria for Government payments.
The below table sets out the payment types and whether 'system assessment' or 'manual assessment' is required, along with providing
guidance on payments that cannot be considered for debt servicing.
Due to the Department of Human Services varying eligibility criteria and means testing associated with some payments, applications containing
government payments need to be referred to a DCA holder to consider:
Each customer's individual circumstances and overall strength of their application (including assets, liabilities and , consistency and
reliability of all income including government payments);
Impacts that the proposed transaction may have on their government payment (particularly in relation to income and asset
testing);
The intended duration of the payment and its availability to rely on for the term of the loan; and
NAB's responsible lending obligation to ensure that the loan is not unsuitable.
To ensure appropriate consideration is provided to all customers, income sources that require manual assessment must be referred to an
appropriate DCA holder for a full review before a customer is provided an outcome on their loan.

Financial Assets to Home Loan
limits
Have verified financial
assets
that are a
minimum of 100% of
the total home loan
limit/s as at application
drawdown or post
bridging.
The intention of this test is to demonstrate that the customer has
already built up sufficient financial assets to be able to repay the
future home loan debt at retirement.
 
If assets are jointly owned by a customer and another applicant/s,
use the total value owned by the applicants.
 
Customers may nominate financial assets solely owned by their
spouse / defacto who is also a co-applicant to the loan.
 
Where a home loan is in joint names, the total of the home loan limit
should be included in the calculation of each applicant’s test, not
just the customer’s share.
 
Brokers do not need to verify assets in excess of the loan limit/s,
examples of acceptable verification documents are listed below.
Downsize owner
occupied property.
Downsize Owner Occupied
Property
Have a minimum of
$200,000 of equity in
their owner-occupied
property and/or verified
financial assets
.
Equity is calculated
by taking the
current verified
property market
value less the
home loan limit/s
at drawdown or
post bridging.
If there is a shortfall,
they must have verified
financial assets
that are a minimum of
100% of the shortfall.
The intention of this test is for the customer to demonstrate that
they will have sufficient equity (minimum $200,0000) in their home
at retirement to buy a downsize property.
 
If assets are jointly owned by a customer and another applicant/s,
use the total value owned by the applicants.
 
Customers may nominate an owner-occupied property solely owned
by their spouse / defacto who is also a co-applicant to the loan.
 
Where a home loan is in joint names, the total of the home loan limit
should be included in the calculation of each applicant’s test, not
just the customer’s share.
 
If the customer/s do not have sufficient equity in their home to pass
the test, the financial asset test may be used to demonstrate they
have a minimum of $200,000 in equity and assets combined.

Financial assets can include savings, investment properties, shares
, managed funds, superannuation and net asset value of company,
business, trust entity but excludes assets being used as a contribution towards the purchase, owner occupied property, vehicles, household
goods and other personal assets.
Shares secured by a margin lending facility cannot be used to verify financial assets. They must not be input into origination systems as part of
strategy test. DCA holders can consider using any remaining equity where documentary evidence is held, confirming both the value of shares
and linked margin lending facility.
Acceptable Verification Documents:
Current Property Value
The most recent valuation held
Most recent rates notice (must confirm ownership and value)
Most recent rates notice or title search (to confirm ownership); and Property profile report (any
value within the range on the report is acceptable)
Financial Assets
Account balances 
Share statements / online trading account statements
The most recently issued superannuation statement
Letter from financial planner confirming the balance of applicant/s holdings
Where the above table requirements cannot be met, any document/s which verifies the ownership and value of asset/s held, in line with ‘10.1
Verification Document Criteria,’ are also acceptable.
System Restrictions
Our origination systems will complete the above tests on an individual applicant basis.
There are instances which are allowable under policy but cannot be catered for by the system – in these cases the repayment at retirement
strategy should be lodged as an ‘exceptional circumstance’ and require manual assessment.
DCA holders may manually perform the assessment to consider if the test would be passed without needing to lodge an exception if the
customers post bridging finance position would reflect the test as passed (normal DCA approval for the bridging finance applies).

12.2 LIVING EXPENSES and Renting a Property / Minimum Board
Current and post general living and entertainment expenses (GLEE)
Brokers must capture customer advised living expenses in the financial position tab within ApplyOnline. Household Expenditure Measurement
(HEM) will be used to validate that these expenses are realistic.
When customer advised expenses are less than HEM, further inquiry must be made to ensure customer/s declared living expenses are consistent
with their circumstances and representative of their actual living expenses. Responses must be recorded with the application.

home for Owner Occupied Principal Place of Residence purposes, this amount does not need to be input post loan.

include a minimum of $500 as a rental expense per month.

12.3 Sole application with joint financial details

an asset purchase. 
For sole applicants with joint financial situations, the following can be used.
Assets
Include the applicants share of assets; and
Where a guarantee is taken from the applicant’s spouse/de-facto 100% of the guarantors’ assets.
Liabilities

liability (e.g. investment loan or margin lending) has been listed, include 100% of the investment asset income.
Expenses
Record the expenses of the applicant(s).
Where expenses are joint with another party, record the applicant(s) portion of that expense (minimum 50%).

12.4 Debt to income (DTI) ratio
The Debt to Income (DTI) ratio measures customers’ lending amount against their income. This measure helps to ensure the customer lending
request is not unsuitable for their income amount.
Brokers must:
Ensure the DTI ratio does not exceed 8 times for new home lending applications, except when DT approved, or referred/declined
for a non-DTI reason;
DTI is defined as: Total borrowers’ debts plus the new home lending limits, divided by, the total unshaded gross annual income.
Note the following:
DTI does not apply where all applicants are non-individuals (e.g. company, trust).
If there are servicing guarantors involved, their income and debts must be captured in DTI.
If there is self-employed income, DTI will use the income received by the applicant, rather than the gross income generated by the
business.
Note: DTI will be automatically calculated by the system.
